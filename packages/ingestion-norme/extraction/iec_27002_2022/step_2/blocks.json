It is to be used as a reference for\n  determining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information\n  security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC  27001. It can also be used as a guidance\n  document for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security\n  controls. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-\n  specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific\n  information security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than\n  those included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.\n  Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit)\n  create, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic,\n  physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).\n  The value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas\n  and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information\n  and other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural,\n  accidental or deliberate.\n  Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules,\n  processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its\n  specific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review\n  and improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a\n  holistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and\n  implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a\n  coherent management system.\n  Many information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be\n  secure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that\n  can be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate\n  management activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place\n  requires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.\n  A successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require\n  participation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject\n  matter experts can also be needed.\n  A suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the\n  organization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated\n  assets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the\n  organization to achieve the stated business objectives.\n  0.2   Information security requirements\n  It is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three\n  main sources of information security requirements:\n  a)\t the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business\n    strategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-\n    specific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to\n    ensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;\n  b)\t the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its\n    interested parties (trading partners, service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-\n    cultural environment;\n                                                vii\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nc)\nthe set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all the steps of the life cycle of\ninformation that an organization has developed to support its operations.\n0.3   Controls\nA control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk. Some of the controls in this document\nare controls that modify risk, while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for example,\ncan only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the information security policy can modify risk.\nMoreover, some controls describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This document\nprovides a generic mixture of organizational, people, physical and technological information security\ncontrols derived from internationally recognized best practices.\n0.4   Determining controls\nDetermining controls is dependent on the organization’s decisions following a risk assessment, with\na clearly defined scope. Decisions related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk\nacceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach applied by the organization. The\ndetermination of controls should also take into consideration all relevant national and international\nlegislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the manner in which controls\ninteract with one another to provide defence in depth.\nThe organization can design controls as required or identify them from any source. In specifying such\ncontrols, the organization should consider the resources and investment needed to implement and\noperate a control against the business value realized. See ISO/IEC TR 27016 for guidance on decisions\nregarding the investment in an ISMS and the economic consequences of these decisions in the context of\ncompeting requirements for resources.\nThere should be a balance between the resources deployed for implementing controls and the potential\nresulting business impact from security incidents in the absence of those controls. The results of a\nrisk assessment should help guide and determine the appropriate management action, priorities for\nmanaging information security risks and for implementing controls determined necessary to protect\nagainst these risks.\nSome of the controls in this document can be considered as guiding principles for information security\nmanagement and as being applicable for most organizations. More information about determining\ncontrols and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IEC 27005.\n0.5   Developing organization-specific guidelines\nThis document can be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines.\nNot all of the controls and guidance in this document can be applicable to all organizations. Additional\ncontrols and guidelines not included in this document can also be required to address the specific needs\nof the organization and the risks that have been identified. When documents are developed containing\nadditional guidelines or controls, it can be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this document\nfor future reference.\n0.6   Life cycle considerations\nInformation has a life cycle, from creation to disposal. The value of, and risks to, information can vary\nthroughout this life cycle (e.g. unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company’s financial accounts is\nnot significant after they have been published, but integrity remains critical) therefore, information\nsecurity remains important to some extent at all stages.\nInformation systems and other assets relevant to information security have life cycles within which\nthey are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and\neventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be considered at every\nstage. New system development projects and changes to existing systems provide opportunities to\nimprove security controls while taking into account the organization’s risks and lessons learned from\nincidents.\nviii\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  0.7   Related International Standards\n  While this document offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are\n  commonly applied in many different organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC  27000 family\n  provide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing\n  information security.\n  Refer to ISO/IEC  27000 for a general introduction to both ISMS and the family of documents.\n  ISO/IEC 27000 provides a glossary, defining most of the terms used throughout the ISO/IEC 27000\n  family of documents, and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family.\n  There are sector-specific standards that have additional controls which aim at addressing specific\n  areas (e.g. ISO/IEC  27017 for cloud services, ISO/IEC  27701 for privacy, ISO/IEC  27019 for energy,\n  ISO/IEC 27011 for telecommunications organizations and ISO 27799 for health). Such standards are\n  included in the Bibliography and some of them are referenced in the guidance and other information\n  sections in Clauses 5-8.\n                                                ix\n\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Information security, cybersecurity and privacy\n  protection — Information security controls\n  1\t Scope\n  This document provides a reference set of generic information security controls including\n  implementation guidance.

controls (Clause 6)\n  c)\n    Physical controls (Clause 7)\n  d)\t Technological controls (Clause 8)\n  There are 2 informative annexes:\n  —\t Annex A — Using attributes\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n—\t Annex B — Correspondence with ISO/IEC 27002:2013\nAnnex A explains how an organization can use attributes (see 4.2) to create its own views based on the\ncontrol attributes defined in this document or of its own creation.\nAnnex  B shows the correspondence between the controls in this edition of ISO/IEC  27002 and the\nprevious 2013 edition.\n4.2\t Themes and attributes\nThe categorization of controls given in Clauses 5 to 8 are referred to as themes.\nControls are categorized as:\na)\t people, if they concern individual people;\nb)\t physical, if they concern physical objects;\nc)\ntechnological, if they concern technology;\nd)\t otherwise they are categorized as organizational.\nThe organization can use attributes to create different views which are different categorizations of\ncontrols as seen from a different perspective to the themes. Attributes can be used to filter, sort or\npresent controls in different views for different audiences. Annex A explains how this can be achieved\nand provides an example of a view.\nBy way of example, each control in this document has been associated with five attributes with\ncorresponding attribute values (preceded by \"#\" to make them searchable), as follows:\na)\t Control type\nControl type is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of when and how the control\nmodifies the risk with regard to the occurrence of an information security incident. Attribute values\nconsist of Preventive (the control that is intended to prevent the occurrence of an information\nsecurity incident), Detective (the control acts when an information security incident occurs) and\nCorrective (the control acts after an information security incident occurs).\nb)\t Information security properties\nInformation security properties is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of which\ncharacteristic of information the control will contribute to preserving. Attribute values consist of\nConfidentiality, Integrity and Availability.\nc)\nCybersecurity concepts\nCybersecurity concepts is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of the association\nof controls to cybersecurity concepts defined in the cybersecurity framework described in\nISO/IEC TS 27110. Attribute values consist of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover.\nd)\t Operational capabilities\nOperational capabilities is an attribute to view controls from the practitioner’s perspective of\ninformation security capabilities. Attribute values consist of Governance, Asset_management,\nInformation_protection,\n            Human_resource_security,\n                          Physical_security,\n                                    System_and_network_\nsecurity,\n      Application_security,\n                  Secure_configuration,\n                              Identity_and_access_management,\nThreat_and_vulnerability_management, Continuity, Supplier_relationships_security, Legal_and_\ncompliance, Information_security_event_management and Information_security_assurance.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  e)\t Security domains\n    Security domains is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of four information security\n    domains: “Governance and Ecosystem” includes “Information System Security Governance &\n    Risk Management” and “Ecosystem cybersecurity management” (including internal and external\n    stakeholders); “Protection” includes “IT Security Architecture”, “IT Security Administration”,\n    “Identity and access management”, “IT Security Maintenance” and “Physical and environmental\n    security”; “Defence” includes “Detection” and “Computer Security Incident Management”;\n    “Resilience” includes “Continuity of operations” and “Crisis management”. Attribute values consist\n    of Governance_and_Ecosystem, Protection, Defence and Resilience.\n  The attributes given in this document are selected because they are considered generic enough to be\n  used by different types of organizations. Organizations can choose to disregard one or more of the\n  attributes given in this document. They can also create attributes of their own (with the corresponding\n  attribute values) to create their own organizational views. Clause  A.2 includes examples of such\n  attributes.\n  4.3\t Control layout\n  The layout for each control contains the following:\n  —\t Control title: Short name of the control;\n  —\t Attribute table: A table shows the value(s) of each attribute for the given control;\n  —\t Control: What the control is;\n  —\t Purpose: Why the control should be implemented;\n  —\t Guidance: How the control should be implemented;\n  —\t Other information: Explanatory text or references to other related documents.\n  Subheadings are used in the guidance text for some controls to aid readability where guidance is lengthy\n  and addresses multiple topics. Such headings are not necessarily used in all guidance text.

Topic-specific policies\nare typically structured to address the needs of certain target groups within an organization or to\ncover certain security areas. Topic-specific policies should be aligned with and complementary to the\ninformation security policy of the organization.\nExamples of such topics include:\na)\t access control;\nb)\t physical and environmental security;\nc)\nasset management;\nd)\t information transfer;\ne)\t secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices;\nf)\nnetworking security;\ng)\t information security incident management;\nh)\t backup;\ni)\ncryptography and key management;\nj)\ninformation classification and handling;\nk)\t management of technical vulnerabilities;\nl)\nsecure development.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  The responsibility for the development, review and approval of the topic-specific policies should be\n  allocated to relevant personnel based on their appropriate level of authority and technical competency.\n  The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information\n  security policy and topic-specific policies and managing information security in response to changes\n  to:\n  a)\t the organization’s business strategy;\n  b)\t the organization’s technical environment;\n  c)\n    regulations, statutes, legislation and contracts;\n  d)\t information security risks;\n  e)\t the current and projected information security threat environment;\n  f)\n    lessons learned from information security events and incidents.\n  The review of information security policy and topic-specific policies should take the results of\n  management reviews and audits into account. Review and update of other related policies should be\n  considered when one policy is changed to maintain consistency.\n  The information security policy and topic-specific policies should be communicated to relevant\n  personnel and interested parties in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the\n  intended reader. Recipients of the policies should be required to acknowledge they understand and\n  agree to comply with the policies where applicable. The organization can determine the formats\n  and names of these policy documents that meet the organization’s needs. In some organizations, the\n  information security policy and topic-specific policies can be in a single document. The organization\n  can name these topic-specific policies as standards, directives, policies or others.\n  If the information security policy or any topic-specific policy is distributed outside the organization,\n  care should be taken not to improperly disclose confidential information.\n  Table 1 illustrates the differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy.\n    Table 1 — Differences between information security policy and topic-specific policy\n                  Information security policy\n                                    Topic-specific policy\n  Level of detail\n                    General or high-level\n                                    Specific and detailed\n  Documented and formally\n  approved by\n                    Top management\n                                  Appropriate level of management\n  Other information\n  Topic-specific policies can vary across organizations.\n  5.2\t Information security roles and responsibilities\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                    Cybersecurity\n                      concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Identify\n                            #Governance\n                                    #Governance_and_Ecosys­\n                                    tem #Protection #Resilience\n  Control\n  Information security roles and responsibilities should be defined and allocated according to the\n  organization needs.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nPurpose\nTo establish a defined, approved and understood structure for the implementation, operation and\nmanagement of information security within the organization.\nGuidance\nAllocation of information security roles and responsibilities should be done in accordance with the\ninformation security policy and topic-specific policies (see 5.1). The organization should define and\nmanage responsibilities for:\na)\t protection of information and other associated assets;\nb)\t carrying out specific information security processes;\nc)\ninformation security risk management activities and in particular acceptance of residual risks (e.g.\nto risk owners);\nd)\t all personnel using an organization’s information and other associated assets.\nThese responsibilities should be supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for\nspecific sites and information processing facilities. Individuals with allocated information security\nresponsibilities can assign security tasks to others. However, they remain accountable and should\ndetermine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed.\nEach security area for which individuals are responsible should be defined, documented and\ncommunicated. Authorization levels should be defined and documented. Individuals who take on a\nspecific information security role should be competent in the knowledge and skills required by the role\nand should be supported to keep up to date with developments related to the role and required in order\nto fulfil the responsibilities of the role.\nOther information\nMany organizations appoint an information security manager to take overall responsibility for the\ndevelopment and implementation of information security and to support the identification of risks and\nmitigating controls.\nHowever, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls often remains with individual\nmanagers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible\nfor its day-to-day protection.\nDepending on the size and resourcing of an organization, information security can be covered by\ndedicated roles or duties carried out in addition to existing roles.\n5.3\t Segregation of duties\nControl type\n        Information\n      security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                  concepts\n                          Operational\n                          capabilities\n                                    Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                #Protect\n                        #Governance\n                        #Identity_and_ac­\n                        cess_management\n                                  #Governance_and_Ecosys­\n                                  tem\nControl\nConflicting duties and conflicting areas of responsibility should be segregated.\nPurpose\nTo reduce the risk of fraud, error and bypassing of information security controls.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Guidance\n  Segregation of duties and areas of responsibility aims to separate conflicting duties between different\n  individuals in order to prevent one individual from executing potential conflicting duties on their own.\n  The organization should determine which duties and areas of responsibility need to be segregated. The\n  following are examples of activities that can require segregation:\n  a)\t initiating, approving and executing a change;\n  b)\t requesting, approving and implementing access rights;\n  c)\n    designing, implementing and reviewing code;\n  d)\t developing software and administering production systems;\n  e)\t using and administering applications;\n  f)\n    using applications and administering databases;\n  g)\t designing, auditing and assuring information security controls.\n  The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the segregation controls. Small\n  organizations can find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied\n  as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls should be\n  considered, such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision.\n  Care should be taken when using role-based access control systems to ensure that persons are not\n  granted conflicting roles. When there is a large number of roles, the organization should consider using\n  automated tools to identify conflicts and facilitate their removal. Roles should be carefully defined and\n  provisioned to minimize access problems if a role is removed or reassigned.\n  Other information\n  No other information.\n  5.4\t Management responsibilities\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                      concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Identify\n                            #Governance\n                                    #Governance_and_Ecosys­\n                                    tem\n  Control\n  Management should require all personnel to apply information security in accordance with the\n  established information security policy, topic-specific policies and procedures of the organization.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure management understand their role in information security and undertake actions aiming to\n  ensure all personnel are aware of and fulfil their information security responsibilities.\n  Guidance\n  Management should demonstrate support of the information security policy, topic-specific policies,\n  procedures and information security controls.\n  Management responsibilities should include ensuring that personnel:\n  a)\t are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being granted\n    access to the organization’s information and other associated assets;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nb)\t are provided with guidelines which state the information security expectations of their role within\nthe organization;\nc)\nare mandated to fulfil the information security policy and topic-specific policies of the organization;\nd)\t achieve a level of awareness of information security relevant to their roles and responsibilities\nwithin the organization (see 6.3);\ne)\t compliance with the terms and conditions of employment, contract or agreement, including the\norganization’s information security policy and appropriate methods of working;\nf)\ncontinue to have the appropriate information security skills and qualifications through ongoing\nprofessional education;\ng)\t where practicable, are provided with a confidential channel for reporting violations of information\nsecurity policy, topic-specific policies or procedures for information security (“whistleblowing”).\nThis can allow for anonymous reporting, or have provisions to ensure that knowledge of the\nidentity of the reporter is known only to those who need to deal with such reports;\nh)\t are provided with adequate resources and project planning time for implementing the organization’s\nsecurity-related processes and controls.\nOther information\nNo other information.\n5.5\t Contact with authorities\nControl type\n        Information\n      security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                            Operational\n                            capabilities\n                                    Security domains\n#Preventive\n#Corrective\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                #Identify #Protect\n                #Respond #Recover\n                            #Governance\n                                    #Defence\n                                    #Resilience\nControl\nThe organization should establish and maintain contact with relevant authorities.\nPurpose\nTo ensure appropriate flow of information takes place with respect to information security between\nthe organization and relevant legal, regulatory and supervisory authorities.\nGuidance\nThe organization should specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law enforcement, regulatory\nbodies, supervisory authorities) should be contacted and how identified information security incidents\nshould be reported in a timely manner.\nContacts with authorities should also be used to facilitate the understanding about the current and\nupcoming expectations of these authorities (e.g. applicable information security regulations).\nOther information\nOrganizations under attack can request authorities to take action against the attack source.\nMaintaining such contacts can be a requirement to support information security incident management\n(see 5.24 to 5.28) or the contingency planning and business continuity processes (see 5.29 and 5.30).\nContacts with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in\nrelevant laws or regulations that affect the organization.

relating to information security threats should be collected and analysed to produce threat\n  intelligence.\n  Purpose\n  To provide awareness of the organization’s threat environment so that the appropriate mitigation\n  actions can be taken.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nGuidance\nInformation about existing or emerging threats is collected and analysed in order to:\na)\t facilitate informed actions to prevent the threats from causing harm to the organization;\nb)\t reduce the impact of such threats.\nThreat intelligence can be divided into three layers, which should all be considered:\na)\t strategic threat intelligence: exchange of high-level information about the changing threat\nlandscape (e.g. types of attackers or types of attacks);\nb)\t tactical threat intelligence: information about attacker methodologies, tools and technologies\ninvolved;\nc)\noperational threat intelligence: details about specific attacks, including technical indicators.\nThreat intelligence should be:\na)\t relevant (i.e. related to the protection of the organization);\nb)\t insightful (i.e. providing the organization with an accurate and detailed understanding of the\nthreat landscape);\nc)\ncontextual, to provide situational awareness (i.e. adding context to the information based on the\ntime of events, where they occur, previous experiences and prevalence in similar organizations);\nd)\t actionable (i.e. the organization can act on information quickly and effectively).\nThreat intelligence activities should include:\na)\t establishing objectives for threat intelligence production;\nb)\t identifying, vetting and selecting internal and external information sources that are necessary and\nappropriate to provide information required for the production of threat intelligence;\nc)\ncollecting information from selected sources, which can be internal and external;\nd)\t processing information collected to prepare it for analysis (e.g. by translating, formatting or\ncorroborating information);\ne)\t analysing information to understand how it relates and is meaningful to the organization;\nf)\ncommunicating and sharing it to relevant individuals in a format that can be understood.\nThreat intelligence should be analysed and later used:\na)\t by implementing processes to include information gathered from threat intelligence sources into\nthe organization’s information security risk management processes;\nb)\t as additional input to technical preventive and detective controls like firewalls, intrusion detection\nsystem, or anti malware solutions;\nc)\nas input to the information security test processes and techniques.\nThe organization should share threat intelligence with other organizations on a mutual basis in order\nto improve overall threat intelligence.\nOther information\nOrganizations can use threat intelligence to prevent, detect, or respond to threats. Organizations can\nproduce threat intelligence, but more typically receive and make use of threat intelligence produced by\nother sources.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Threat intelligence is often provided by independent providers or advisors, government agencies or\n  collaborative threat intelligence groups.\n  The effectiveness of controls such as 5.25, 8.7, 8.16 or 8.23, depends on the quality of available threat\n  intelligence.\n  5.8\t Information security in project management\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                    Cybersecurity\n                      concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Identify #Protect\n                            #Governance\n                                    #Governance_and_Ecosys­\n                                    tem #Protection\n  Control\n  Information security should be integrated into project management.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure information security risks related to projects and deliverables are effectively addressed in\n  project management throughout the project life cycle.\n  Guidance\n  Information security should be integrated into project management to ensure information security risks\n  are addressed as part of the project management. This can be applied to any type of project regardless\n  of its complexity, size, duration, discipline or application area (e.g. a project for a core business process,\n  ICT, facility management or other supporting processes).\n  The project management in use should require that:\n  a)\t information security risks are assessed and treated at an early stage and periodically as part of\n    project risks throughout the project life cycle;\n  b)\t information security requirements [e.g. application security requirements (8.26), requirements\n    for complying with intellectual property rights (5.32), etc.] are addressed in the early stages of\n    projects;\n  c)\n    information security risks associated with the execution of projects, such as security of internal\n    and external communication aspects are considered and treated throughout the project life cycle;\n  d)\t progress on information security risk treatment is reviewed and effectiveness of the treatment is\n    evaluated and tested.\n  The appropriateness of the information security considerations and activities should be followed up at\n  predefined stages by suitable persons or governance bodies, such as the project steering committee.\n  Responsibilities and authorities for information security relevant to the project should be defined and\n  allocated to specified roles.\n  Information security requirements for products or services to be delivered by the project should be\n  determined using various methods, including deriving compliance requirements from information\n  security policy, topic-specific policies and regulations. Further information security requirements can\n  be derived from activities such as threat modelling, incident reviews, use of vulnerability thresholds\n  or contingency planning, thus ensuring that the architecture and design of information systems are\n  protected against known threats based on the operational environment.\n  Information security requirements should be determined for all types of projects, not only ICT\n  development projects. The following should also be considered when determining these requirements:\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\na)\t what information is involved (information determination), what are the corresponding information\nsecurity needs (classification; see 5.12) and the potential negative business impact which can result\nfrom lack of adequate security;\nb)\t the required protection needs of information and other associated assets involved, particularly in\nterms of confidentiality, integrity and availability;\nc)\nthe level of confidence or assurance required towards the claimed identity of entities in order to\nderive the authentication requirements;\nd)\t access provisioning and authorization processes, for customers and other potential business users\nas well as for privileged or technical users such as relevant project members, potential operation\nstaff or external suppliers;\ne)\t informing users of their duties and responsibilities;\nf)\nrequirements derived from business processes, such as transaction logging and monitoring, non-\nrepudiation requirements;\ng)\t requirements mandated by other information security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and\nmonitoring or data leakage detection systems);\nh)\t compliance with the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual environment in which the\norganization operates;\ni)\nlevel of confidence or assurance required for third parties to meet the organization’s information\nsecurity policy and topic-specific policies including relevant security clauses in any agreements or\ncontracts.\nOther information\nThe project development approach, such as waterfall life cycle or agile life cycle, should support\ninformation security in a structured way that can be adapted to suit the assessed severity of the\ninformation security risks, based on the character of the project. Early consideration of information\nsecurity requirements for the product or service (e.g. at the planning and design stages), can lead\nto more effective and cost-efficient solutions for quality and information security. ISO  21500 and\nISO 21502 provide guidance on concepts and processes of project management that are important for\nthe performance of projects.\nISO/IEC 27005 provides guidance on the use of risk management processes to identify controls to meet\ninformation security requirements.\n5.9\t Inventory of information and other associated assets\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                            Operational\n                            capabilities\n                                    Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Identify\n                          #Asset_manage­\n                          ment\n                                    #Governance_and_Eco­\n                                    system #Protection\nControl\nAn inventory of information and other associated assets, including owners, should be developed and\nmaintained.\nPurpose\nTo identify the organization’s information and other associated assets in order to preserve their\ninformation security and assign appropriate ownership.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Guidance\n  Inventory\n  The organization should identify its information and other associated assets and determine their\n  importance in terms of information security. Documentation should be maintained in dedicated or\n  existing inventories as appropriate.\n  The inventory of information and other associated assets should be accurate, up to date, consistent and\n  aligned with other inventories. Options for ensuring accuracy of an inventory of information and other\n  associated assets include:\n  a)\t conducting regular reviews of identified information and other associated assets against the asset\n    inventory;\n  b)\t automatically enforcing an inventory update in the process of installing, changing or removing an\n    asset.\n  The location of an asset should be included in the inventory as appropriate.\n  The inventory does not need to be a single list of information and other associated assets. Considering\n  that the inventory should be maintained by the relevant functions, it can be seen as a set of dynamic\n  inventories, such as inventories for information assets, hardware, software, virtual machines (VMs),\n  facilities, personnel, competence, capabilities and records.\n  Each asset should be classified in accordance with the classification of the information (see 5.12)\n  associated to that asset.\n  The granularity of the inventory of information and other associated assets should be at a level\n  appropriate for the needs of the organization. Sometimes specific instances of assets in the information\n  life cycle are not feasible to be documented due to the nature of the asset. An example of a short-lived\n  asset is a VM instance whose life cycle can be of short duration.\n  Ownership\n  For the identified information and other associated assets, ownership of the asset should be assigned\n  to an individual or a group and the classification should be identified (see 5.12, 5.13). A process to\n  ensure timely assignment of asset ownership should be implemented. Ownership should be assigned\n  when assets are created or when assets are transferred to the organization. Asset ownership should be\n  reassigned as necessary when current asset owners leave or change job roles.\n  Owner duties\n  The asset owner should be responsible for the proper management of an asset over the whole asset life\n  cycle, ensuring that:\n  a)\t information and other associated assets are inventoried;\n  b)\t information and other associated assets are appropriately classified and protected;\n  c)\n    the classification is reviewed periodically;\n  d)\t components supporting technology assets are listed and linked, such as database, storage, software\n    components and sub-components;\n  e)\t requirements for the acceptable use of information and other associated assets (see 5.10) are\n    established;\n  f)\n    access restrictions correspond with the classification and that they are effective and are reviewed\n    periodically;\n  g)\t information and other associated assets, when deleted or disposed, are handled in a secure manner\n    and removed from the inventory;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nh)\t they are involved in the identification and management of risks associated with their asset(s);\ni)\nthey support personnel who have the roles and responsibilities of managing their information.\nOther information\nInventories of information and other associated assets are often necessary to ensure the effective\nprotection of information and can be required for other purposes, such as health and safety, insurance\nor financial reasons. Inventories of information and other associated assets also support risk\nmanagement, audit activities, vulnerability management, incident response and recovery planning.\nTasks and responsibilities can be delegated (e.g. to a custodian looking after the assets on a daily basis),\nbut the person or group who delegated them remains accountable.\nIt can be useful to designate groups of information and other associated assets which act together to\nprovide a particular service. In this case, the owner of this service is accountable for the delivery of the\nservice, including the operation of its assets.\nSee ISO/IEC 19770-1 for additional information on information technology (IT) asset management.

Assets other than information can also be classified in compliance with classification of\ninformation, which is stored in, processed by or otherwise handled or protected by the asset.\nOwners of information should be accountable for their classification.\nThe classification scheme should include conventions for classification and criteria for review of the\nclassification over time. Results of classification should be updated in accordance with changes of the\nvalue, sensitivity and criticality of information through their life cycle.\nThe scheme should be aligned to the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.1) and should be able\nto address specific business needs of the organization.\nThe classification can be determined by the level of impact that the information's compromise would\nhave for the organization. Each level defined in the scheme should be given a name that makes sense in\nthe context of the classification scheme’s application.\nThe scheme should be consistent across the whole organization and included in its procedures so that\neveryone classifies information and applicable other associated assets in the same way. In this manner,\neveryone has a common understanding of protection requirements and applies appropriate protection.\nThe classification scheme used within the organization can be different from the schemes used by\nother organizations, even if the names for levels are similar. In addition, information moving between\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  organizations can vary in classification depending on its context in each organization, even if their\n  classification schemes are identical. Therefore, agreements with other organizations that include\n  information sharing should include procedures to identify the classification of that information and to\n  interpret the classification levels from other organizations. Correspondence between different schemes\n  can be determined by looking for equivalence in the associated handling and protection methods.\n  Other information\n  Classification provides people who deal with information with a concise indication of how to handle\n  and protect it. Creating groups of information with similar protection needs and specifying information\n  security procedures that apply to all the information in each group facilitates this. This approach\n  reduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls.\n  Information can cease to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time. For example, when the\n  information has been made public, it no longer has confidentiality requirements but can still require\n  protection for its integrity and availability properties. These aspects should be taken into account,\n  as over-classification can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional\n  expense or, on the contrary, under-classification can lead to insufficient controls to protect the\n  information from compromise.\n  As an example, an information confidentiality classification scheme can be based on four levels as\n  follows:\n  a)\t disclosure causes no harm;\n  b)\t disclosure causes minor reputational damage or minor operational impact;\n  c)\n    disclosure has a significant short-term impact on operations or business objectives;\n  d)\t disclosure has a serious impact on long term business objectives or puts the survival of the\n    organization at risk.\n  5.13\tLabelling of information\n    Control type\n            Information\n            security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                      concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n            #Confidentiality\n            #Integrity\n            #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                            #Information_\n                            protection\n                                      #Defence\n                                      #Protection\n  Control\n  An appropriate set of procedures for information labelling should be developed and implemented in\n  accordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the organization.\n  Purpose\n  To facilitate the communication of classification of information and support automation of information\n  processing and management.\n  Guidance\n  Procedures for information labelling should cover information and other associated assets in all\n  formats. The labelling should reflect the classification scheme established in 5.12. The labels should\n  be easily recognizable. The procedures should give guidance on where and how labels are attached in\n  consideration of how the information is accessed or the assets are handled depending on the types of\n  storage media. The procedures can define:\n  a)\t cases where labelling is omitted (e.g. labelling of non-confidential information to reduce workloads);\n  b)\t how to label information sent by or stored on electronic or physical means, or any other format;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nc)\nhow to handle cases where labelling is not possible (e.g. due to technical restrictions).\nExamples of labelling techniques include:\na)\t physical labels;\nb)\t headers and footers;\nc)\nmetadata;\nd)\t watermarking;\ne)\t rubber-stamps.\nDigital information should utilize metadata in order to identify, manage and control information,\nespecially with regard to confidentiality. Metadata should also enable efficient and correct searching for\ninformation. Metadata should facilitate systems to interact and make decisions based on the associated\nclassification labels.\nThe procedures should describe how to attach metadata to information, what labels to use and how\ndata should be handled, in line with the organization’s information model and ICT architecture.\nRelevant additional metadata should be added by systems when they process information depending\non its information security properties.\nPersonnel and other interested parties should be made aware of labelling procedures. All personnel\nshould be provided with the necessary training to ensure that information is correctly labelled and\nhandled accordingly.\nOutput from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical should carry\nan appropriate classification label.\nOther information\nLabelling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing.\nOther useful metadata that can be attached to the information is which organizational process created\nthe information and at what time.\nLabelling of information and other associated assets can sometimes have negative effects. Classified\nassets can be easier to identify by malicious actors for potential misuse.\nSome systems do not label individual files or database records with their classification but protect all\ninformation at the highest level of classification of any of the information that it contains or is permitted\nto contain. It is usual in such systems to determine and then label information when it is exported.\n5.14\tInformation transfer\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                            Operational\n                            capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                          #Asset_management\n                          #Information_protection\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nInformation transfer rules, procedures, or agreements should be in place for all types of transfer\nfacilities within the organization and between the organization and other parties.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Purpose\n  To maintain the security of information transferred within an organization and with any external\n  interested party.\n  Guidance\n  General\n  The organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific policy on information transfer\n  to all relevant interested parties. Rules, procedures and agreements to protect information in transit\n  should reflect the classification of the information involved. Where information is transferred between\n  the organization and third parties, transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be\n  established and maintained to protect information in all forms in transit (see 5.10).\n  Information transfer can happen through electronic transfer, physical storage media transfer and\n  verbal transfer.\n  For all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and agreements should include:\n  a)\t controls designed to protect transferred information from interception, unauthorized access,\n    copying, modification, misrouting, destruction and denial of service, including levels of access\n    control commensurate with the classification of the information involved and any special controls\n    that are required to protect sensitive information, such as use of cryptographic techniques (see\n    8.24);\n  b)\t controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including maintaining a chain of custody for\n    information while in transit;\n  c)\n    identification of appropriate contacts related to the transfer including information owners, risk\n    owners, security officers and information custodians, as applicable;\n  d)\t responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss of physical\n    storage media or data;\n  e)\t use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the meaning\n    of the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately protected (see\n    5.13);\n  f)\n    reliability and availability of the transfer service;\n  g)\t the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of information transfer facilities (see 5.10);\n  h)\t retention and disposal guidelines for all business records, including messages;\n  NOTE\n      Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention and disposal of business records.\n  i)\n    the consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements\n    (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34) related to transfer of information (e.g. requirements for electronic\n    signatures).\n  Electronic transfer\n  Rules, procedures and agreements should also consider the following items when using electronic\n  communication facilities for information transfer:\n  a)\t detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic\n    communications (see 8.7);\n  b)\t protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment;\n  c)\n    prevention against sending documents and messages in communications to the wrong address or\n    number;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nd)\t obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as instant messaging, social\nnetworking, file sharing or cloud storage;\ne)\t stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks;\nf)\nrestrictions associated with electronic communication facilities (e.g. preventing automatic\nforwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses);\ng)\t advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short message service (SMS) or instant\nmessages with critical information since these can be read in public places (and therefore by\nunauthorized persons) or stored in devices not adequately protected;\nh)\t advising personnel and other interested parties about the problems of using fax machines or\nservices, namely:\n1)\t unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages;\n2)\t deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers.\nPhysical storage media transfer\nWhen transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules, procedures and agreements should\nalso include:\na)\t responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt;\nb)\t ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;\nc)\npackaging that protects the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit\nand in accordance with any manufacturers’ specifications, for example protecting against any\nenvironmental factors that can reduce the effectiveness of restoring storage media such as\nexposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; using minimum technical standards for\npackaging and transmission (e.g. the use of opaque envelopes);\nd)\t a list of authorized reliable couriers agreed by management;\ne)\t courier identification standards;\nf)\ndepending on the classification level of the information in the storage media to be transported, use\ntamper evident or tamper-resistant controls (e.g. bags, containers);\ng)\t procedures to verify the identification of couriers;\nh)\t approved list of third parties providing transportation or courier services depending on the\nclassification of the information;\ni)\nkeeping logs for identifying the content of the storage media, the protection applied as well as\nrecording the list of authorised recipients, the times of transfer to the transit custodians and\nreceipt at the destination.\nVerbal transfer\nTo protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other interested parties should be reminded\nthat they should:\na)\t not have confidential verbal conversations in public places or over insecure communication\nchannels since these can be overheard by unauthorized persons;\nb)\t not leave messages containing confidential information on answering machines or voice messages\nsince these can be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored\nincorrectly as a result of misdialling;\nc)\nbe screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  d)\t ensure that appropriate room controls are implemented (e.g. sound-proofing, closed door);\n  e)\t begin any sensitive conversations with a disclaimer so those present know the classification level\n    and any handling requirements of what they are about to hear.\n  Other information\n  No other information.\n  5.15\tAccess control\n    Control type\n            Information\n            security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n            #Confidentiality\n            #Integrity\n            #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Identity_and_ac­\n                              cess_management\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  Rules to control physical and logical access to information and other associated assets should be\n  established and implemented based on business and information security requirements.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other associated\n  assets.\n  Guidance\n  Owners of information and other associated assets should determine information security and business\n  requirements related to access control. A topic-specific policy on access control should be defined which\n  takes account of these requirements and should be communicated to all relevant interested parties.\n  These requirements and the topic-specific policy should consider the following:\n  a)\t determining which entities require which type of access to the information and other associated\n    assets;\n  b)\t security of applications (see 8.26);\n  c)\n    physical access, which needs to be supported by appropriate physical entry controls (see 7.2, 7.3,\n    7.4);\n  d)\t information dissemination and authorization (e.g. the need-to-know principle) and information\n    security levels and classification of information (see 5.10, 5.12, 5.13);\n  e)\t restrictions to privileged access (see 8.2);\n  f)\n    segregation of duties (see 5.3);\n  g)\t relevant legislation, regulations and any contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to\n    data or services (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34, 8.3);\n  h)\t segregation of access control functions (e.g. access request, access authorization, access\n    administration);\n  i)\n    formal authorization of access requests (see 5.16 and 5.18);\n  j)\n    the management of access rights (see 5.18);\n  k)\t logging (see 8.15).\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nAccess control rules should be implemented by defining and mapping appropriate access rights and\nrestrictions to the relevant entities (see 5.16). An entity can represent a human user as well as a\ntechnical or logical item (e.g. a machine, device or a service). To simplify the access control management,\nspecific roles can be assigned to entity groups.\nThe following should be taken into account when defining and implementing access control rules:\na)\t consistency between the access rights and information classification;\nb)\t consistency between the access rights and the physical perimeter security needs and requirements;\nc)\nconsidering all types of available connections in distributed environments so entities are only\nprovided with access to information and other associated assets, including networks and network\nservices, that they are authorized to use;\nd)\t considering how elements or factors relevant to dynamic access control can be reflected.\nOther information\nThere are often overarching principles used in the context of access control. Two of the most frequently\nused principles are:\na)\t need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information which that entity requires in\norder to perform its tasks (different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and\nhence different access profiles);\nb)\t need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a\nclear need is present.\nCare should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:\na)\t establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege, “Everything is generally forbidden unless\nexpressly permitted”, rather than the weaker rule, “Everything is generally permitted unless\nexpressly forbidden”;\nb)\t changes in information labels (see 5.13) that are initiated automatically by information processing\nfacilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;\nc)\nchanges in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those\ninitiated by an administrator;\nd)\t when to define and regularly review the approval.\nAccess control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4,\n8.5, 8.18) and defined responsibilities (see 5.2, 5.17).\nThere are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC (mandatory access control), DAC\n(discretionary access control), RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access\ncontrol).\nAccess control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or\nspecific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging\nfrom covering whole networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties\nsuch as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and\nhow granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more\ngranularity typically lead to higher cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used\nto define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is required.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  5.16\tIdentity management\n    Control type\n            Information\n            security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n            #Confidentiality\n            #Integrity\n            #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Identity_and_ac­\n                              cess_management\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  The full life cycle of identities should be managed.\n  Purpose\n  To allow for the unique identification of individuals and systems accessing the organization’s\n  information and other associated assets and to enable appropriate assignment of access rights.\n  Guidance\n  The processes used in the context of identity management should ensure that:\n  a)\t for identities assigned to persons, a specific identity is only linked to a single person to be able to\n    hold the person accountable for actions performed with this specific identity;\n  b)\t identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they\n    are necessary for business or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and\n    documentation;\n  c)\n    identities assigned to non-human entities are subject to appropriately segregated approval and\n    independent ongoing oversight;\n  d)\t identities are disabled or removed in a timely fashion if they are no longer required (e.g. if their\n    associated entities are deleted or no longer used, or if the person linked to an identity has left the\n    organization or changed the role);\n  e)\t in a specific domain, a single identity is mapped to a single entity, [i.e. mapping of multiple identities\n    to the same entity within the same context (duplicate identities) is avoided];\n  f)\n    records of all significant events concerning the use and management of user identities and of\n    authentication information are kept.\n  The organization should have a supporting process in place to handle changes to information related\n  to user identities. These processes can include re-verification of trusted documents related to a person.\n  When using identities provided or issued by third parties (e.g. social media credentials), the organization\n  should ensure the third-party identities provide the required trust level and any associated risks are\n  known and sufficiently treated. This can include controls related to the third parties (see 5.19) as well\n  as controls related to associated authentication information (see 5.17).\n  Other information\n  Providing or revoking access to information and other associated assets is usually a multi-step\n  procedure:\n  a)\t confirming the business requirements for an identity to be established;\n  b)\t verifying the identity of an entity before allocating them a logical identity;\n  c)\n    establishing an identity;\n  d)\t configuring and activating the identity.

Personal secret\nauthentication information is not to be shared with anyone. Secret authentication information used\nin the context of identities linked to multiple users or linked to non-personal entities are solely\nshared with authorized persons;\nb)\t affected or compromised authentication information is changed immediately upon notification of\nor any other indication of a compromise;\nc)\nwhen passwords are used as authentication information, strong passwords according to best\npractice recommendations are selected, for example:\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n    1)\t passwords are not based on anything somebody else can easily guess or obtain using person-\n      related information (e.g. names, telephone numbers and dates of birth);\n    2)\t passwords are not based on dictionary words or combinations thereof;\n    3)\t use easy to remember passphrases and try to include alphanumerical and special characters;\n    4)\t passwords have a minimum length;\n  d)\t the same passwords are not used across distinct services and systems;\n  e)\t the obligation to follow these rules is also included in terms and conditions of employment (see\n    6.2).\n  Password management system\n  When passwords are used as authentication information, the password management system should:\n  a)\t allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation procedure to\n    address input errors;\n  b)\t enforce strong passwords according to good practice recommendations [see c) of \"User\n    responsibilities];\n  c)\n    force users to change their passwords at first login;\n  d)\t enforce password changes as necessary, for example after a security incident, or upon termination\n    or change of employment when a user has known passwords for identities that remain active (e.g.\n    shared identities);\n  e)\t prevent re-use of previous passwords;\n  f)\n    prevent the use of commonly-used passwords and compromised usernames, password\n    combinations from hacked systems;\n  g)\t not display passwords on the screen when being entered;\n  h)\t store and transmit passwords in protected form.\n  Password encryption and hashing should be performed according to approved cryptographic\n  techniques for passwords (see 8.24).\n  Other information\n  Passwords or passphrases are a commonly used type of authentication information and are a common\n  means of verifying a user’s identity. Other types of authentication information are cryptographic keys,\n  data stored on hardware tokens (e.g. smart cards) that produce authentication codes and biometric\n  data such as iris scans or fingerprints. Additional information can be found in the ISO/IEC 24760 series.\n  Requiring frequent change of passwords can be problematic because users can get annoyed by the\n  frequent changes, forget new passwords, note them down in unsafe places, or choose unsafe passwords.\n  Provision of single sign on (SSO) or other authentication management tools (e.g. password vaults)\n  reduces the amount of authentication information that users are required to protect and can thereby\n  increase the effectiveness of this control. However, these tools can also increase the impact of disclosure\n  of authentication information.\n  Some applications require user passwords to be assigned by an independent authority. In such cases, a),\n  c) and d) of \"Password management system\" do not apply.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n5.18\tAccess rights\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Identity_and_ac­\n                            cess_management\n                                    #Protection\nControl\nAccess rights to information and other associated assets should be provisioned, reviewed, modified\nand removed in accordance with the organization’s topic-specific policy on and rules for access control.\nPurpose\nTo ensure access to information and other associated assets is defined and authorized according to the\nbusiness requirements.\nGuidance\nProvision and revocation of access rights\nThe provisioning process for assigning or revoking physical and logical access rights granted to an\nentity’s authenticated identity should include:\na)\t obtaining authorization from the owner of the information and other associated assets for the use\nof the information and other associated assets (see 5.9).

Access requests and reviews of\n  access rights are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level of particular rights.\n  Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel contracts and service contracts that\n  specify sanctions if unauthorized access is attempted by personnel (see 5.20, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6).\n  In cases of management-initiated termination, disgruntled personnel or external party users can\n  deliberately corrupt information or sabotage information processing facilities. In cases of persons\n  resigning or being dismissed, they can be tempted to collect information for future use.\n  Cloning is an efficient way for organizations to assign access to users.

These processes and procedures should\ninclude those to be implemented by the organization, as well as those the organization requires the\nsupplier to implement for the commencement of use of a supplier’s products or services or for the\ntermination of use of a supplier’s products and services, such as:\na)\t identifying and documenting the types of suppliers (e.g. ICT services, logistics, utilities, financial\nservices, ICT infrastructure components) which can affect the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of the organization's information;\nb)\t establishing how to evaluate and select suppliers according to the sensitivity of information,\nproducts and services (e.g. with market analysis, customer references, review of documents, on-\nsite assessments, certifications);\nc)\nevaluating and selecting supplier’s products or services that have adequate information security\ncontrols and reviewing them; in particular, accuracy and completeness of controls implemented\nby the supplier that ensure integrity of the supplier’s information and information processing and\nhence the organization’s information security;\nd)\t defining the organization’s information, ICT services and the physical infrastructure that suppliers\ncan access, monitor, control or use;\ne)\t defining the types of ICT infrastructure components and services provided by suppliers which can\naffect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization's information;\nf)\nassessing and managing the information security risks associated with:\n1)\t the suppliers’ use of the organization’s information and other associated assets, including risks\n  originating from potential malicious supplier personnel;\n2)\t malfunctioning or vulnerabilities of the products (including software components and sub-\n  components used in these products) or services provided by the suppliers;\ng)\t monitoring compliance with established information security requirements for each type of\nsupplier and type of access, including third-party review and product validation;\nh)\t mitigating non-compliance of a supplier, whether this was detected through monitoring or by other\nmeans;\ni)\nhandling incidents and contingencies associated with supplier products and services including\nresponsibilities of both the organization and suppliers;\nj)\nresilience and, if necessary, recovery and contingency measures to ensure the availability of the\nsupplier’s information and information processing and hence the availability of the organization’s\ninformation;\nk)\t awareness and training for the organization’s personnel interacting with supplier personnel\nregarding appropriate rules of engagement, topic-specific policies, processes and procedures\nand behaviour based on the type of supplier and the level of supplier access to the organization’s\nsystems and information;\nl)\nmanaging the necessary transfer of information, other associated assets and anything else that\nneeds to be changed and ensuring that information security is maintained throughout the transfer\nperiod;\nm)\t requirements to ensure a secure termination of the supplier relationship, including:\n1)\t de-provisioning of access rights;\n2)\t information handling;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n    3)\t determining ownership of intellectual property developed during the engagement;\n    4)\t information portability in case of change of supplier or insourcing;\n    6)\t records management;\n    7)\t return of assets;\n    8)\t secure disposal of information and other associated assets;\n    9)\t ongoing confidentiality requirements;\n  n)\t level of personnel security and physical security expected from supplier's personnel and facilities.\n  The procedures for continuing information processing in the event that the supplier becomes unable to\n  supply its products or services (e.g. because of an incident, because the supplier is no longer in business,\n  or no longer provides some components due to technology advancements) should be considered to\n  avoid any delay in arranging replacement products or services (e.g. identifying an alternative supplier\n  in advance or always using alternative suppliers).\n  Other information\n  In cases where it is not possible for an organization to place requirements on a supplier, the organization\n  should:\n  a)\t consider the guidance given in this control in making decisions about choosing a supplier and its\n    product or service;\n  b)\t implement compensating controls as necessary based on a risk assessment.\n  Information can be put at risk by suppliers with inadequate information security management. Controls\n  should be determined and applied to manage the supplier's access to information and other associated\n  assets. For example, if there is a special need for confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure\n  agreements or cryptographic techniques can be used. Another example is personal data protection\n  risks when the supplier agreement involves transfer of, or access to, information across borders. The\n  organization needs to be aware that the legal or contractual responsibility for protecting information\n  remains with the organization.\n  Risks can also be caused by inadequate controls of ICT infrastructure components or services provided\n  by suppliers. Malfunctioning or vulnerable components or services can cause information security\n  breaches in the organization or to another entity (e.g. they can cause malware infection, attacks or\n  other harm on entities other than the organization).\n  See ISO/IEC 27036-2 for more detail.\n  5.20\tAddressing information security within supplier agreements\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Identify\n                              #Supplier_relation­\n                              ships_security\n                                        #Governance_and_\n                                        Ecosystem #Protec­\n                                        tion\n  Control\n  Relevant information security requirements should be established and agreed with each supplier based\n  on the type of supplier relationship.\n  Purpose\n  To maintain an agreed level of information security in supplier relationships.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nGuidance\nSupplier agreements should be established and documented to ensure that there is clear understanding\nbetween the organization and the supplier regarding both parties’ obligations to fulfil relevant\ninformation security requirements.\nThe following terms can be considered for inclusion in the agreements in order to satisfy the identified\ninformation security requirements:\na)\t description of the information to be provided or accessed and methods of providing or accessing\nthe information;\nb)\t classification of information according to the organization’s classification scheme (see 5.10, 5.12,\n5.13);\nc)\nmapping between the organization’s own classification scheme and the classification scheme of the\nsupplier;\nd)\t legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements, including data protection, handling\nof personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property rights and copyright and a\ndescription of how it will be ensured that they are met;\ne)\t obligation of each contractual party to implement an agreed set of controls, including access\ncontrol, performance review, monitoring, reporting and auditing, and the supplier’s obligations to\ncomply with the organization’s information security requirements;\nf)\nrules of acceptable use of information and other associated assets, including unacceptable use if\nnecessary;\ng)\t procedures or conditions for authorization and removal of the authorization for the use of the\norganization’s information and other associated assets by supplier personnel (e.g. through an\nexplicit list of supplier personnel authorized to use the organization’s information and other\nassociated assets);\nh)\t information security requirements regarding the supplier’s ICT infrastructure;

Examples of such supplier review\nmethods can include penetration testing and proof or validation of third-party attestations for the\nsupplier’s information security operations;\ng)\t implementing a process for identifying and documenting product or service components that\nare critical for maintaining functionality and therefore require increased attention, scrutiny\nand further follow up required when built outside of the organization especially if the supplier\noutsources aspects of product or service components to other suppliers;\nh)\t obtaining assurance that critical components and their origin can be traced throughout the supply\nchain;\ni)\nobtaining assurance that the delivered ICT products are functioning as expected without any\nunexpected or unwanted features;\nj)\nimplementing processes to ensure that components from suppliers are genuine and unaltered from\ntheir specification. Example measures include anti-tamper labels, cryptographic hash verifications\nor digital signatures. Monitoring for out of specification performance can be an indicator of\ntampering or counterfeits. Prevention and detection of tampering should be implemented during\nmultiple stages in the system development life cycle, including design, development, integration,\noperations and maintenance;\nk)\t obtaining assurance that ICT products achieve required security levels, for example, through formal\ncertification or an evaluation scheme such as the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement;\nl)\ndefining rules for sharing of information regarding the supply chain and any potential issues and\ncompromises among the organization and suppliers;\nm)\t implementing specific processes for managing ICT component life cycle and availability and\nassociated security risks. This includes managing the risks of components no longer being available\ndue to suppliers no longer being in business or suppliers no longer providing these components due\nto technology advancements. Identification of an alternative supplier and the process to transfer\nsoftware and competence to the alternative supplier should be considered.\nOther information\nThe specific ICT supply chain risk management practices are built on top of general information\nsecurity, quality, project management and system engineering practices but do not replace them.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Organizations are advised to work with suppliers to understand the ICT supply chain and any matters\n  that have an important effect on the products and services being provided. The organization can\n  influence ICT supply chain information security practices by making clear in agreements with their\n  suppliers the matters that should be addressed by other suppliers in the ICT supply chain.\n  ICT should be acquired from reputable sources. The reliability of software and hardware is a matter\n  of quality control. While it is generally not possible for an organization to inspect the quality control\n  systems of its vendors, it can make reliable judgments based on the reputation of the vendor.\n  ICT supply chain as addressed here includes cloud services.\n  Examples of ICT supply chains are:\n  a)\t cloud services provisioning, where the cloud service provider relies on the software developers,\n    telecommunication service providers, hardware providers;\n  b)\t IoT, where the service involves the device manufacturers, the cloud service providers (e.g. the\n    IoT platform operators), the developers for mobile and web applications, the vendor of software\n    libraries;\n  c)\n    hosting services, where the provider relies on external service desks including first, second and\n    third support levels.\n  See ISO/IEC 27036-3 for more details including risk assessment guidance.\n  Software identification (SWID) tags can also help to achieve better information security in the supply\n  chain, by providing information about software provenance.

It can be an extension or part of the existing approach for how\n  an organization manages services provided by external parties (see 5.21 and 5.22).\n  The use of cloud services can involve shared responsibility for information security and collaborative\n  effort between the cloud service provider and the organization acting as the cloud service customer. It\n  is essential that the responsibilities for both the cloud service provider and the organization, acting as\n  the cloud service customer, are defined and implemented appropriately.\n  The organization should define:\n  a)\t all relevant information security requirements associated with the use of the cloud services;\n  b)\t cloud service selection criteria and scope of cloud service usage;\n  c)\n    roles and responsibilities related to the use and management of cloud services;\n  d)\t which information security controls are managed by the cloud service provider and which are\n    managed by the organization as the cloud service customer;\n  e)\t how to obtain and utilize information security capabilities provided by the cloud service provider;\n  f)\n    how to obtain assurance on information security controls implemented by cloud service providers;\n  g)\t how to manage controls, interfaces and changes in services when an organization uses multiple\n    cloud services, particularly from different cloud service providers;\n  h)\t procedures for handling information security incidents that occur in relation to the use of cloud\n    services;\n  i)\n    its approach for monitoring, reviewing and evaluating the ongoing use of cloud services to manage\n    information security risks;\n  j)\n    how to change or stop the use of cloud services including exit strategies for cloud services.\n  Cloud service agreements are often pre-defined and not open to negotiation. For all cloud services,\n  the organization should review cloud service agreements with the cloud service provider(s). A cloud\n  service agreement should address the confidentiality, integrity, availability and information handling\n  requirements of the organization, with appropriate cloud service level objectives and cloud service\n  qualitative objectives. The organization should also undertake relevant risk assessments to identify\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nthe risks associated with using the cloud service. Any residual risks connected to the use of the cloud\nservice should be clearly identified and accepted by the appropriate management of the organization.\nAn agreement between the cloud service provider and the organization, acting as the cloud service\ncustomer, should include the following provisions for the protection of the organization’s data and\navailability of services:\na)\t providing solutions based on industry accepted standards for architecture and infrastructure;\nb)\t managing access controls of the cloud service to meet the requirements of the organization;\nc)\nimplementing malware monitoring and protection solutions;\nd)\t processing and storing the organization’s sensitive information in approved locations (e.g.\nparticular country or region) or within or subject to a particular jurisdiction;\ne)\t providing dedicated support in the event of an information security incident in the cloud service\nenvironment;\nf)\nensuring that the organization’s information security requirements are met in the event of cloud\nservices being further sub-contracted to an external supplier (or prohibiting cloud services from\nbeing sub-contracted);\ng)\t supporting the organization in gathering digital evidence, taking into consideration laws and\nregulations for digital evidence across different jurisdictions;\nh)\t providing appropriate support and availability of services for an appropriate time frame when the\norganization wants to exit from the cloud service;\ni)\nproviding required backup of data and configuration information and securely managing backups\nas applicable, based on the capabilities of the cloud service provider used by the organization,\nacting as the cloud service customer;\nj)\nproviding and returning information such as configuration files, source code and data that are\nowned by the organization, acting as the cloud service customer, when requested during the\nservice provision or at termination of service.\nThe organization, acting as the cloud service customer, should consider whether the agreement should\nrequire cloud service providers to provide advance notification prior to any substantive customer\nimpacting changes being made to the way the service is delivered to the organization, including:\na)\t changes to the technical infrastructure (e.g. relocation, reconfiguration, or changes in hardware or\nsoftware) that affect or change the cloud service offering;\nb)\t processing or storing information in a new geographical or legal jurisdiction;\nc)\nuse of peer cloud service providers or other sub-contractors (including changing existing or using\nnew parties).\nThe organization using cloud services should maintain close contact with its cloud service providers.\nThese contacts enable mutual exchange of information about information security for the use of the\ncloud services including a mechanism for both cloud service provider and the organization, acting as the\ncloud service customer, to monitor each service characteristic and report failures to the commitments\ncontained in the agreements.\nOther information\nThis control considers cloud security from the perspective of the cloud service customer.\nAdditional information relating to cloud services can be found in ISO/IEC 17788, ISO/IEC 17789 and\nISO/IEC 22123-1.

The requirements of\n  different jurisdictions should be considered to maximize chances of admission across the relevant\n  jurisdictions.\n  In general, these procedures for the management of evidence should provide instructions for the\n  identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of evidence in accordance with different types\n  of storage media, devices and status of devices (i.e. powered on or off). Evidence typically needs to be\n  collected in a manner that is admissible in the appropriate national courts of law or another disciplinary\n  forum. It should be possible to show that:\n  a)\t records are complete and have not been tampered with in any way;\n  b)\t copies of electronic evidence are probably identical to the originals;\n  c)\n    any information system from which evidence has been gathered was operating correctly at the\n    time the evidence was recorded.\n  Where available, certification or other relevant means of qualification of personnel and tools should be\n  sought, so as to strengthen the value of the preserved evidence.\n  Digital evidence can transcend organizational or jurisdictional boundaries.

The BIA process\n  should use impact types and criteria to assess the impacts over time resulting from the disruption of\n  business activities that deliver products and services. The magnitude and duration of the resulting\n  impact should be used to identify prioritized activities which should be assigned a recovery time\n  objective (RTO). The BIA should then determine which resources are needed to support prioritized\n  activities. An RTO should also be specified for these resources. A subset of these resources should\n  include ICT services.\n  The BIA involving ICT services can be expanded to define performance and capacity requirements of\n  ICT systems and recovery point objectives (RPO) of information required to support activities during\n  disruption.\n  Based on the outputs from the BIA and risk assessment involving ICT services, the organization should\n  identify and select ICT continuity strategies that consider options for before, during and after disruption.\n  The business continuity strategies can comprise one or more solutions. Based on the strategies, plans\n  should be developed, implemented and tested to meet the required availability level of ICT services and\n  in the required time frames following interruption to, or failure of, critical processes.\n  The organization should ensure that:\n  a)\t an adequate organizational structure is in place to prepare for, mitigate and respond to a disruption\n    supported by personnel with the necessary responsibility, authority and competence;\n  b)\t ICT continuity plans, including response and recovery procedures detailing how the organization\n    is planning to manage an ICT service disruption, are:\n    1)\t regularly evaluated through exercises and tests;\n    2)\t approved by management;\n  c)\n    ICT continuity plans include the following ICT continuity information:\n    1)\t performance and capacity specifications to meet the business continuity requirements and\n      objectives as specified in the BIA;\n    2)\t RTO of each prioritized ICT service and the procedures for restoring those components;\n    3)\t RPO of the prioritized ICT resources defined as information and the procedures for restoring\n      the information.\n  Other information\n  Managing ICT continuity forms a key part of business continuity requirements concerning availability\n  to be able to:\n  a)\t respond and recover from disruption to ICT services regardless of the cause;\n  b)\t ensure continuity of prioritized activities are supported by the required ICT services;\n  c)\n    respond before a disruption to ICT services occurs, and upon detection of at least one incident that\n    can result in a disruption to ICT services.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nFurther guidance on ICT readiness for business continuity can be found in ISO/IEC 27031.\nFurther guidance on business continuity management systems can be found in ISO 22301 and ISO 22313.\nFurther guidance on BIA can be found in ISO/TS 22317.\n5.31\tLegal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Identify\n                            #Legal_and_compli­\n                            ance\n                                    #Governance_and_\n                                    Ecosystem #Protec­\n                                    tion\nControl\nLegal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements relevant to information security and the\norganization’s approach to meet these requirements should be identified, documented and kept up to\ndate.\nPurpose\nTo ensure compliance with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements related to\ninformation security.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nExternal requirements including legal, statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements should be\ntaken into consideration when:\na)\t developing information security policies and procedures;\nb)\t designing, implementing or changing information security controls;\nc)\nclassifying information and other associated assets as part of the process for setting information\nsecurity requirements for internal needs or for supplier agreements;\nd)\t performing information security risk assessments and determining information security risk\ntreatment activities;\ne)\t determining processes along with related roles and responsibilities relating to information\nsecurity;\nf)\ndetermining suppliers’ contractual requirements relevant to the organization and the scope of\nsupply of products and services.\nLegislation and regulations\nThe organization should:\na)\t identify all legislation and regulations relevant to the organization’s information security in order\nto be aware of the requirements for their type of business;\nb)\t take into consideration compliance in all relevant countries, if the organization:\n—\t conducts business in other countries;\n—\t uses products and services from other countries where laws and regulations can affect the\n  organization;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n    —\t transfers information across jurisdictional borders where laws and regulations can affect the\n      organization;\n  c)\n    review the identified legislation and regulation regularly in order to keep up to date with the\n    changes and identify new legislation;\n  d)\t define and document the specific processes and individual responsibilities to meet these\n    requirements.\n  Cryptography\n  Cryptography is an area that often has specific legal requirements.

These guidelines should be aligned with the organization’s\n    topic-specific policy on records management and other records requirements;\n  b)\t draw up a retention schedule defining records and the period of time for which they should be\n    retained.\n  The system of storage and handling should ensure identification of records and of their retention\n  period taking into consideration national or regional legislation or regulations, as well as community or\n  societal expectations, if applicable. This system should permit appropriate destruction of records after\n  that period if they are not needed by the organization.\n  When deciding on protection of specific organizational records, their corresponding information\n  security classification, based on the organization’s classification scheme, should be considered.\n  Records should be categorized into record types (e.g. accounting records, business transaction records,\n  personnel records, legal records), each with details of retention periods and type of allowable storage\n  media which can be physical or electronic.\n  Data storage systems should be chosen such that required records can be retrieved in an acceptable\n  time frame and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.\n  Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access records (both\n  storage media and format readability) throughout the retention period should be established to\n  safeguard against loss due to future technology change. Any related cryptographic keys and programs\n  associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures, should also be retained to enable decryption\n  of the records for the length of time the records are retained (see 8.24).\n  Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with recommendations\n  provided by manufacturers of storage media. Consideration should be given to the possibility of\n  deterioration of media used for storage of records.\n  Other information\n  Records document individual events or transactions or can form aggregations that have been designed\n  to document work processes, activities or functions. They are both evidence of business activity and\n  information assets. Any set of information, regardless of its structure or form, can be managed as a\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nrecord. This includes information in the form of a document, a collection of data or other types of digital\nor analogue information which are created, captured and managed in the course of business.\nIn the management of records, metadata is data describing the context, content and structure of\nrecords, as well as their management over time. Metadata is an essential component of any record.\nIt can be necessary to retain some records securely to meet legal, statutory, regulatory or contractual\nrequirements, as well as to support essential business activities. National law or regulation can set the\ntime period and data content for information retention.

These procedures should be communicated to all relevant interested parties involved\nin the processing of personally identifiable information.\nCompliance with these procedures and all relevant legislation and regulations concerning the\npreservation of privacy and protection of PII requires appropriate roles, responsibilities and controls.\nOften this is best achieved by the appointment of a person responsible, such as a privacy officer, who\nshould provide guidance to personnel, service providers and other interested parties on their individual\nresponsibilities and the specific procedures that should be followed.\nResponsibility for handling PII should be dealt with taking into consideration relevant legislation and\nregulations.\nAppropriate technical and organizational measures to protect PII should be implemented.\nOther information\nA number of countries have introduced legislation placing controls on the collection, processing,\ntransmission and deletion of PII. Depending on the respective national legislation, such controls can\nimpose duties on those collecting, processing and disseminating PII and can also restrict the authority\nto transfer PII to other countries.\nISO/IEC 29100 provides a high-level framework for the protection of PII within ICT systems. Further\ninformation on privacy information management systems can be found in ISO/IEC  27701.

These terms and conditions should be appropriate to the nature and extent of access they\nwill have to the organization’s assets associated with information systems and services. The terms and\nconditions concerning information security should be reviewed when laws, regulations, the information\nsecurity policy or topic-specific policies change.\nWhere appropriate, responsibilities contained within the terms and conditions of employment should\ncontinue for a defined period after the end of the employment (see 6.5).\nOther information\nA code of conduct can be used to state personnel’s information security responsibilities regarding\nconfidentiality, PII protection, ethics, appropriate use of the organization’s information and other\nassociated assets, as well as reputable practices expected by the organization.\nAn external party, with which supplier personnel are associated, can be required to enter into\ncontractual agreements on behalf of the contracted individual.\nIf the organization is not a legal entity and does not have employees, the equivalent of contractual\nagreement and terms and conditions can be considered in line with the guidance of this control.\n6.3\t Information security awareness, education and training\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Human_resource_\n                            security\n                                    #Governance_and_\n                                    Ecosystem\nControl\nPersonnel of the organization and relevant interested parties should receive appropriate information\nsecurity awareness, education and training and regular updates of the organization's information\nsecurity policy, topic-specific policies and procedures, as relevant for their job function.\nPurpose\nTo ensure personnel and relevant interested parties are aware of and fulfil their information security\nresponsibilities.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Guidance\n  General\n  An information security awareness, education and training programme should be established in line\n  with the organization’s information security policy, topic-specific policies and relevant procedures on\n  information security, taking into consideration the organization’s information to be protected and the\n  information security controls that have been implemented to protect the information.\n  Information security awareness, education and training should take place periodically. Initial\n  awareness, education and training can apply to new personnel and to those who transfer to new\n  positions or roles with substantially different information security requirements.\n  Personnel’s understanding should be assessed at the end of an awareness, education or training activity\n  to test knowledge transfer and the effectiveness of the awareness, education and training programme.\n  Awareness\n  An information security awareness programme should aim to make personnel aware of their\n  responsibilities for information security and the means by which those responsibilities are discharged.\n  The awareness programme should be planned taking into consideration the roles of personnel in the\n  organization, including internal and external personnel (e.g. external consultants, supplier personnel).\n  The activities in the awareness programme should be scheduled over time, preferably regularly, so\n  that the activities are repeated and cover new personnel. It should also be built on lessons learnt from\n  information security incidents.\n  The awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising activities via appropriate\n  physical or virtual channels such as campaigns, booklets, posters, newsletters, websites, information\n  sessions, briefings, e-learning modules and e-mails.\n  Information security awareness should cover general aspects such as:\n  a)\t management’s commitment to information security throughout the organization;\n  b)\t familiarity and compliance needs concerning applicable information security rules and obligations,\n    taking into account information security policy and topic-specific policies, standards, laws,\n    statutes, regulations, contracts and agreements;\n  c)\n    personal accountability for one’s own actions and inactions, and general responsibilities towards\n    securing or protecting information belonging to the organization and interested parties;\n  d)\t basic information security procedures [e.g. information security event reporting (6.8)] and baseline\n    controls [e.g. password security (5.17)];\n  e)\t contact points and resources for additional information and advice on information security\n    matters, including further information security awareness materials.\n  Education and training\n  The organization should identify, prepare and implement an appropriate training plan for technical\n  teams whose roles require specific skill sets and expertise. Technical teams should have the skills for\n  configuring and maintaining the required security level for devices, systems, applications and services.\n  If there are missing skills, the organization should take action and acquire them.\n  The education and training programme should consider different forms [e.g. lectures or self-studies,\n  being mentored by expert staff or consultants (on-the-job training), rotating staff members to follow\n  different activities, recruiting already skilled people and hiring consultants]. It can use different means\n  of delivery including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based, self-paced and others. Technical\n  personnel should keep their knowledge up to date by subscribing to newsletters and magazines or by\n  attending conferences and events aimed at technical and professional improvement.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nOther information\nWhen composing an awareness programme, it is important not only to focus on the ’what’ and ’how’,\nbut also the ’why’, when possible. It is important that personnel understand the aim of information\nsecurity and the potential effect, positive and negative, on the organization of their own behaviour.\nInformation security awareness, education and training can be part of, or conducted in collaboration\nwith, other activities, for example general information management, ICT, security, privacy or safety\ntraining.\n6.4\t Disciplinary process\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive #Cor­\nrective\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect #Respond\n                            #Human_resource_\n                            security\n                                    #Governance_and_\n                                    Ecosystem\nControl\nA disciplinary process should be formalized and communicated to take actions against personnel and\nother relevant interested parties who have committed an information security policy violation.\nPurpose\nTo ensure personnel and other relevant interested parties understand the consequences of information\nsecurity policy violation, to deter and appropriately deal with personnel and other relevant interested\nparties who committed the violation.\nGuidance\nThe disciplinary process should not be initiated without prior verification that an information security\npolicy violation has occurred (see 5.28).\nThe formal disciplinary process should provide for a graduated response that takes into consideration\nfactors such as:\na)\t the nature (who, what, when, how) and gravity of the breach and its consequences;\nb)\t whether the offence was intentional (malicious) or unintentional (accidental);\nc)\nwhether or not this is a first or repeated offence;\nd)\t whether or not the violator was properly trained.\nThe response should take into consideration relevant legal, statutory, regulatory contractual and\nbusiness requirements as well as other factors as required.

This can\n  include confidentiality of information, intellectual property and other knowledge obtained, as well as\n  responsibilities contained within any other confidentiality agreement (see 6.6). Responsibilities and\n  duties still valid after termination of employment or contract should be contained in the individual’s\n  terms and conditions of employment (see 6.2), contract or agreement. Other contracts or agreements\n  that continue for a defined period after the end of the individual’s employment can also contain\n  information security responsibilities.\n  Changes of responsibility or employment should be managed as the termination of the current\n  responsibility or employment combined with the initiation of the new responsibility or employment.\n  Information security roles and responsibilities held by any individual who leaves or changes job roles\n  should be identified and transferred to another individual.\n  A process should be established for the communication of the changes and of operating procedures to\n  personnel, other interested parties and relevant contact persons (e.g. to customers and suppliers).\n  The process for the termination or change of employment should also be applied to external personnel\n  (i.e. suppliers) when a termination occurs of personnel, the contract or the job with the organization, or\n  when there is a change of the job within the organization.\n  Other information\n  In many organizations, the human resources function is generally responsible for the overall termination\n  process and works together with the supervising manager of the person transitioning to manage the\n  information security aspects of the relevant procedures. In the case of personnel provided through an\n  external party (e.g. through a supplier), this termination process is undertaken by the external party in\n  accordance with the contract between the organization and the external party.\n  6.6 Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements\n  Control type\n          Information\n          security properties\n                    Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n                  #Protect\n                            #Human_resource_security\n                            #Information_protection\n                            #Supplier_relationships\n                                        #Governance_and_\n                                        Ecosystem\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nControl\nConfidentiality or non-disclosure agreements reflecting the organization’s needs for the protection of\ninformation should be identified, documented, regularly reviewed and signed by personnel and other\nrelevant interested parties.\nPurpose\nTo maintain confidentiality of information accessible by personnel or external parties.\nGuidance\nConfidentiality or non-disclosure agreements should address the requirement to protect confidential\ninformation using legally enforceable terms.

Water pumps or equivalent means\nshould be readily made available in case flooding occurs;\nc)\nelectrical surges: adopting systems able to protect both server and client information systems\nagainst electrical surges or similar events to minimize the consequences of such events;\nd)\t explosives and weapons: performing random inspections for the presence of explosives or weapons\non personnel, vehicles or goods entering sensitive information processing facilities.\nOther information\nSafes or other forms of secure storage facilities can protect information stored therein against disasters\nsuch as a fire, earthquake, flood or explosion.\nOrganizations can consider the concepts of crime prevention through environmental design when\ndesigning the controls to secure their environment and reduce urban threats. For example, instead of\nusing bollards, statues or water features can serve as both a feature and a physical barrier.\n7.6\t Working in secure areas\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Physical_security\n                                    #Protection\nControl\nSecurity measures for working in secure areas should be designed and implemented.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Purpose\n  To protect information and other associated assets in secure areas from damage and unauthorized\n  interference by personnel working in these areas.\n  Guidance\n  The security measures for working in secure areas should apply to all personnel and cover all activities\n  taking place in the secure area.\n  The following guidelines should be considered:\n  a)\t making personnel aware only of the existence of, or activities within, a secure area on a need-to-\n    know basis;\n  b)\t avoiding unsupervised work in secure areas both for safety reasons and to reduce chances for\n    malicious activities;\n  c)\n    physically locking and periodically inspecting vacant secure areas;\n  d)\t not allowing photographic, video, audio or other recording equipment, such as cameras in user\n    endpoint devices, unless authorized;\n  e)\t appropriately controlling the carrying and use of user endpoint devices in secure areas;\n  f)\n    posting emergency procedures in a readily visible or accessible manner.\n  Other information\n  No other information.\n  7.7\t Clear desk and clear screen\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n                    #Protect\n                              #Physical_security\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  Clear desk rules for papers and removable storage media and clear screen rules for information\n  processing facilities should be defined and appropriately enforced.\n  Purpose\n  To reduce the risks of unauthorized access, loss of and damage to information on desks, screens and in\n  other accessible locations during and outside normal working hours.\n  Guidance\n  The organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific policy on clear desk and clear\n  screen to all relevant interested parties.\n  The following guidelines should be considered:\n  a)\t locking away sensitive or critical business information (e.g. on paper or on electronic storage\n    media) (ideally in a safe, cabinet or other form of security furniture) when not required, especially\n    when the office is vacated;\n  b)\t protecting user endpoint devices by key locks or other security means when not in use or\n    unattended;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nc)\nleaving user endpoint devices logged off or protected with a screen and keyboard locking\nmechanism controlled by a user authentication mechanism when unattended.

See 7.10 for detailed\nguidance on secure disposal of storage media and 8.10 for guidance on information deletion.\nLabels and markings identifying the organization or indicating the classification, owner, system or\nnetwork, should be removed prior to disposal, including reselling or donating to charity.\nThe organization should consider the removal of security controls such as access controls or surveillance\nequipment at the end of lease or when moving out of premises. This depends on factors such as:\na)\t its lease agreement to return the facility to original condition;\nb)\t minimizing the risk of leaving systems with sensitive information on them for the next tenant (e.g.\nuser access lists, video or image files);\nc)\nthe ability to reuse the controls at the next facility.\nOther information\nDamaged equipment containing storage media can require a risk assessment to determine whether\nthe items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded.

The topic-specific policy should be communicated to all relevant personnel and\n  consider the following:\n  a)\t the type of information and the classification level that the user endpoint devices can handle,\n    process, store or support;\n  b)\t registration of user endpoint devices;\n  c)\n    requirements for physical protection;\n  d)\t restriction of software installation (e.g. remotely controlled by system administrators);\n  e)\t requirements for user endpoint device software (including software versions) and for applying\n    updates (e.g. active automatic updating);\n  f)\n    rules for connection to information services, public networks or any other network off premises\n    (e.g. requiring the use of personal firewall);\n  g)\t access controls;\n  h)\t storage device encryption;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\ni)\nprotection against malware;\nj)\nremote disabling, deletion or lockout;\nk)\t backups;\nl)\nusage of web services and web applications;\nm)\t end user behaviour analytics (see 8.16);\nn)\t the use of removable devices, including removable memory devices, and the possibility of disabling\nphysical ports (e.g. USB ports);\no)\t the use of partitioning capabilities, if supported by the user endpoint device, which can securely\nseparate the organization's information and other associated assets (e.g. software) from other\ninformation and other associated assets on the device.\nConsideration should be given as to whether certain information is so sensitive that it can only be\naccessed via user endpoint devices, but not stored on such devices. In such cases, additional technical\nsafeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that downloading files for offline\nworking is disabled and that local storage such as SD card is disabled.\nAs far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be enforced through configuration\nmanagement (see 8.9) or automated tools.\nUser responsibility\nAll users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting user\nendpoint devices, as well as of their responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users\nshould be advised to:\na)\t log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer needed;\nb)\t protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical control (e.g. key lock or\nspecial locks) and logical control (e.g. password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying\nimportant, sensitive or critical business information unattended;\nc)\nuse devices with special care in public places, open offices, meeting places and other unprotected\nareas (e.g. avoid reading confidential information if people can read from the back, use privacy\nscreen filters);\nd)\t physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars and other forms of transport,\nhotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places).\nA specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual (including insurance)\nand other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of\nuser endpoint devices.\nUse of personal devices\nWhere the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes known as BYOD), in addition to\nthe guidance given in this control, the following should be considered:\na)\t separation of personal and business use of the devices, including using software to support such\nseparation and protect business data on a private device;\nb)\t providing access to business information only after users have acknowledged their duties (physical\nprotection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping\nof data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use\nthe service. In such cases, PII protection legislation should be considered;\nc)\ntopic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property\ndeveloped on privately owned equipment;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  d)\t access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an\n    investigation), which can be prevented by legislation;\n  e)\t software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can become liable for licensing for\n    client software on user endpoint devices owned privately by personnel or external party users.\n  Wireless connections\n  The organization should establish procedures for:\n  a)\t the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling vulnerable protocols);\n  b)\t using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in accordance with relevant\n    topic-specific policies (e.g. because backups or software updates are needed).\n  Other information\n  Controls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on whether the user endpoint device\n  is used only inside of the organization's secured premises and network connections, or whether it is\n  exposed to increased physical and network related threats outside of the organization.\n  The wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to other types of network connections\n  but have important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. In particular,\n  back-up of information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail because of limited network\n  bandwidth or because user endpoint devices are not connected at the times when backups are\n  scheduled.\n  For some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not possible because it is used for other\n  purposes (e.g. power delivery and display output).\n  8.2\t Privileged access rights\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational capa­\n                                  bilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Identity_and_ac­\n                              cess_management\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  The allocation and use of privileged access rights should be restricted and managed.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure only authorized users, software components and services are provided with privileged\n  access rights.\n  Guidance\n  The allocation of privileged access rights should be controlled through an authorization process in\n  accordance with the relevant topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15). The following should be\n  considered:\n  a)\t identifying users who need privileged access rights for each system or process (e.g. operating\n    systems, database management systems and applications);\n  b)\t allocating privileged access rights to users as needed and on an event-by-event basis in line with\n    the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15) (i.e. only to individuals with the necessary\n    competence to carry out activities that require privileged access and based on the minimum\n    requirement for their functional roles);\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nc)\nmaintaining an authorization process (i.e. determining who can approve privileged access rights,\nor not granting privileged access rights until the authorization process is complete) and a record of\nall privileges allocated;\nd)\t defining and implementing requirements for expiry of privileged access rights;\ne)\t taking measures to ensure that users are aware of their privileged access rights and when they are\nin privileged access mode. Possible measures include using specific user identities, user interface\nsettings or even specific equipment;\nf)\nauthentication requirements for privileged access rights can be higher than the requirements for\nnormal access rights. Re-authentication or authentication step-up can be necessary before doing\nwork with privileged access rights;\ng)\t regularly, and after any organizational change, reviewing users working with privileged access\nrights in order to verify if their duties, roles, responsibilities and competence still qualify them for\nworking with privileged access rights (see 5.18);\nh)\t establishing specific rules in order to avoid the use of generic administration user IDs (such as\n“root”), depending on systems’ configuration capabilities. Managing and protecting authentication\ninformation of such identities (see 5.17);\ni)\ngranting temporary privileged access just for the time window necessary to implement approved\nchanges or activities (e.g. for maintenance activities or some critical changes), rather than\npermanently granting privileged access rights. This is often referred as break glass procedure, and\noften automated by privilege access management technologies;\nj)\nlogging all privileged access to systems for audit purposes;\nk)\t not sharing or linking identities with privileged access rights to multiple persons, assigning each\nperson a separate identity which allows assigning specific privileged access rights. Identities\ncan be grouped (e.g. by defining an administrator group) in order to simplify the management of\nprivileged access rights;\nl)\nonly using identities with privileged access rights for undertaking administrative tasks and not\nfor day-to-day general tasks [i.e. checking email, accessing the web (users should have a separate\nnormal network identity for these activities)].\nOther information\nPrivileged access rights are access rights provided to an identity, a role or a process that allows the\nperformance of activities that typical users or processes cannot perform. System administrator roles\ntypically require privileged access rights.\nInappropriate use of system administrator privileges (any feature or facility of an information system\nthat enables the user to override system or application controls) is a major contributory factor to\nfailures or breaches of systems.\nMore information related to access management and the secure management of access to information\nand information and communications technologies resources can be found in ISO/IEC 29146.\n8.3\t Information access restriction\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Identity_and_ac­\n                            cess_management\n                                    #Protection\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Control\n  Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the\n  established topic-specific policy on access control.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure only authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other\n  associated assets.\n  Guidance\n  Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the\n  established topic-specific policies. The following should be considered in order to support access\n  restriction requirements:\n  a)\t not allowing access to sensitive information by unknown user identities or anonymously. Public\n    or anonymous access should only be granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive\n    information;\n  b)\t providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information in systems, applications and\n    services;\n  c)\n    controlling which data can be accessed by a particular user;\n  d)\t controlling which identities or group of identities have which access, such as read, write, delete and\n    execute;\n  e)\t providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application\n    data, or systems.\n  Further, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect sensitive information that\n  has high value to the organization should be considered when the organization:\n  a)\t needs granular control over who can access such information during what period and in what way;\n  b)\t wants to share such information with people outside the organization and maintain control over\n    who can access it;\n  c)\n    wants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution of such information;\n  d)\t wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes, copying and distribution\n    (including printing);\n  e)\t wants to monitor the use of the information;\n  f)\n    wants to record any changes to such information that take place in case a future investigation is\n    required.\n  Dynamic access management techniques should protect information throughout its life cycle (i.e.\n  creation, processing, storage, transmission and disposal), including:\n  a)\t establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on specific use cases considering:\n    1)\t granting access permissions based on identity, device, location or application;\n    2)\t leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what information needs to be\n      protected with dynamic access management techniques;\n  b)\t establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and supporting technical\n    infrastructure.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nDynamic access management systems should protect information by:\na)\t requiring authentication, appropriate credentials or a certificate to access information;\nb)\t restricting access, for example to a specified time frame (e.g. after a given date or until a particular\ndate);\nc)\nusing encryption to protect information;\nd)\t defining the printing permissions for the information;\ne)\t recording who accesses the information and how the information is used;\nf)\nraising alerts if attempts to misuse the information are detected.\nOther information\nDynamic access management techniques and other dynamic information protection technologies can\nsupport the protection of information even when data is shared beyond the originating organization,\nwhere traditional access controls cannot be enforced. It can be applied to documents, emails or other\nfiles containing information to limit who can access the content and in what way. It can be at a granular\nlevel and be adapted over the life cycle of the information.\nDynamic access management techniques do not replace classical access management [e.g. using access\ncontrol lists (ACLs)], but can add more factors for conditionality, real-time evaluation, just-in-time data\nreduction and other enhancements that can be useful for the most sensitive information. It offers a\nway to control access outside the organization’s environment. Incident response can be supported by\ndynamic access management techniques as permissions can be modified or revoked at any time.\nAdditional information on a framework for access management is provided in ISO/IEC 29146.\n8.4\t Access to source code\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Identity_and_access_\n                            management\n                            #Application_security\n                            #Secure_configura­\n                            tion\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nRead and write access to source code, development tools and software libraries should be appropriately\nmanaged.\nPurpose\nTo prevent the introduction of unauthorized functionality, avoid unintentional or malicious changes\nand to maintain the confidentiality of valuable intellectual property.\nGuidance\nAccess to source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification plans and\nvalidation plans) and development tools (e.g. compilers, builders, integration tools, test platforms and\nenvironments) should be strictly controlled.\nFor source code, this can be achieved by controlling central storage of such code, preferably in source\ncode management system.\nRead access and write access to source code can differ based on the personnel’s role. For example, read\naccess to source code can be broadly provided inside the organization, but write access to source code\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  is only made available to privileged personnel or designated owners. Where code components are used\n  by several developers within an organization, read access to a centralized code repository should be\n  implemented. Furthermore, if open-source code or third-party code components are used inside an\n  organization, read access to such external code repositories can be broadly provided. However, write\n  access should still be restricted.\n  The following guidelines should be considered to control access to program source libraries in order to\n  reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:\n  a)\t managing the access to program source code and the program source libraries according to\n    established procedures;\n  b)\t granting read and write access to source code based on business needs and managed to address\n    risks of alteration or misuse and according to established procedures;\n  c)\n    updating of source code and associated items and granting of access to source code in accordance\n    with change control procedures (see 8.32) and only performing it after appropriate authorization\n    has been received;\n  d)\t not granting developers direct access to the source code repository, but through developer tools\n    that control activities and authorizations on the source code;\n  e)\t holding program listings in a secure environment, where read and write access should be\n    appropriately managed and assigned;\n  f)\n    maintaining an audit log of all accesses and of all changes to source code.\n  If the program source code is intended to be published, additional controls to provide assurance on its\n  integrity (e.g. digital signature) should be considered.\n  Other information\n  If access to source code is not properly controlled, source code can be modified or some data in the\n  development environment (e.g. copies of production data, configuration details) can be retrieved by\n  unauthorized persons.\n  8.5\t Secure authentication\n    Control type\n            Information\n            security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n            #Confidentiality\n            #Integrity\n            #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Identity_and_ac­\n                              cess_management\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  Secure authentication technologies and procedures should be implemented based on information\n  access restrictions and the topic-specific policy on access control.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure a user or an entity is securely authenticated, when access to systems, applications and\n  services is granted.\n  Guidance\n  A suitable authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user,\n  software, messages and other entities.\n  The strength of authentication should be appropriate for the classification of the information to be\n  accessed. Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nalternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be\nused.\nAuthentication information should be accompanied by additional authentication factors for accessing\ncritical information systems (also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of\nmultiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have and what you are, reduces\nthe possibilities for unauthorized accesses. Multi-factor authentication can be combined with other\ntechniques to require additional factors under specific circumstances, based on predefined rules and\npatterns, such as access from an unusual location, from an unusual device or at an unusual time.\nBiometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is ever compromised. Biometric\nauthentication can be unavailable depending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To\nprepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be accompanied with at least one alternative\nauthentication technique.\nThe procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the risk of\nunauthorized access.

Use of malware\ndetection and repair software alone is not usually adequate. The following guidance should be\nconsidered:\na)\t implementing rules and controls that prevent or detect the use of unauthorized software [e.g.\napplication allowlisting (i.e. using a list providing allowed applications)] (see 8.19 and 8.32);\nb)\t implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of known or suspected malicious websites\n(e.g. blocklisting);\nc)\nreducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware [e.g. through technical vulnerability\nmanagement (see 8.8 and 8.19)];\nd)\t conducting regular automated validation of the software and data content of systems, especially\nfor systems supporting critical business processes; investigating the presence of any unapproved\nfiles or unauthorized amendments;\ne)\t establishing protective measures against risks associated with obtaining files and software either\nfrom or via external networks or on any other medium;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  f)\n    installing and regularly updating malware detection and repair software to scan computers and\n    electronic storage media. Carrying out regular scans that include:\n    1)\t scanning any data received over networks or via any form of electronic storage media, for\n      malware before use;\n    2)\t scanning email and instant messaging attachments and downloads for malware before use.\n      Carrying out this scan at different places (e.g. at email servers, desktop computers) and when\n      entering the network of the organization;\n    3)\t scanning webpages for malware when accessed;\n  g)\t determining the placement and configuration of malware detection and repair tools based on risk\n    assessment outcomes and considering:\n    1)\t defence in depth principles where they would be most effective. For example, this can lead to\n      malware detection in a network gateway (in various application protocols such as email, file\n      transfer and web) as well as user endpoint devices and servers;\n    2)\t the evasive techniques of attackers (e.g. the use of encrypted files) to deliver malware or the\n      use of encryption protocols to transmit malware;\n  h)\t taking care to protect against the introduction of malware during maintenance and emergency\n    procedures, which can bypass normal controls against malware;\n  i)\n    implementing a process to authorize temporarily or permanently disable some or all measures\n    against malware, including exception approval authorities, documented justification and review\n    date. This can be necessary when the protection against malware causes disruption to normal\n    operations;\n  j)\n    preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malware attacks, including\n    all necessary data and software backup (including both online and offline backup) and recovery\n    measures (see 8.13);\n  k)\t isolating environments where catastrophic consequences can occur;\n  l)\n    defining procedures and responsibilities to deal with protection against malware on systems,\n    including training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks;\n  m)\t providing awareness or training (see 6.3) to all users on how to identify and potentially mitigate\n    the receipt, sending or installation of malware infected emails, files or programs [the information\n    collected in n) and o) can be used to ensure awareness and training are kept up-to-date];\n  n)\t implementing procedures to regularly collect information about new malware, such as subscribing\n    to mailing lists or reviewing relevant websites;\n  o)\t verifying that information relating to malware, such as warning bulletins, comes from qualified\n    and reputable sources (e.g. reliable internet sites or suppliers of malware detection software) and\n    is accurate and informative.\n  Other information\n  It is not always possible to install software that protects against malware on some systems (e.g. some\n  industrial control systems). Some forms of malware infect computer operating systems and computer\n  firmware such that common malware controls cannot clean the system and a full reimaging of the\n  operating system software and sometimes the computer firmware is necessary to return to a secure\n  state.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n8.8\t Management of technical vulnerabilities\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                          Operational\n                          capabilities\n                                    Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Identify\n                  #Protect\n                          #Threat_and_\n                          vulnerability_\n                          management\n                                  #Governance_and_Ecosys­\n                                  tem\n                                  #Protection #Defence\nControl\nInformation about technical vulnerabilities of information systems in use should be obtained, the\norganization’s exposure to such vulnerabilities should be evaluated and appropriate measures should\nbe taken.\nPurpose\nTo prevent exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.\nGuidance\nIdentifying technical vulnerabilities\nThe organization should have an accurate inventory of assets (see 5.9 to 5.14) as a prerequisite for\neffective technical vulnerability management; the inventory should include the software vendor,\nsoftware name, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what\nsystems) and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the software.\nTo identify technical vulnerabilities, the organization should consider:\na)\t defining and establishing the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability\nmanagement, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, updating, asset\ntracking and any coordination responsibilities required;\nb)\t for software and other technologies (based on the asset inventory list, see 5.9), identifying\ninformation resources that will be used for identifying relevant technical vulnerabilities and\nmaintaining awareness about them. Updating the list of information resources based on changes in\nthe inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;\nc)\nrequiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability\nreporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);\nd)\t using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities\nand to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;\ne)\t conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments\nby competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising\ncaution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;\nf)\ntracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should be\nincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).\nThe organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:\na)\t detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component\nused in these;\nb)\t receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.\nThe organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability\ndisclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish\nvulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat\nintelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programs\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  where rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order\n  to appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent\n  industry bodies or other interested parties.\n  Evaluating technical vulnerabilities\n  To evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:\n  a)\t analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;\n  b)\t once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and\n    the actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other\n    controls.\n  Taking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilities\n  A software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved\n  patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the\n  original software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should\n  be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades.\n  If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.\n  The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:\n  a)\t taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical\n    vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical\n    vulnerabilities;\n  b)\t depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action\n    according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information\n    security incident response procedures (see 5.26);\n  c)\n    only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);\n  d)\t testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not\n    result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks\n    associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared\n    with the risk of installing the update)];\n  e)\t addressing systems at high risk first;\n  f)\n    develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);\n  g)\t test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;\n  h)\t provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;\n  i)\n    if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:\n    1)\t applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;\n    2)\t turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;\n    3)\t adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);\n    4)\t shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of\n      suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);\n    5)\t increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;\n    6)\t raising awareness of the vulnerability.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nFor acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their\nsoftware and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide\nwhether to use the automatic update or not.\nOther considerations\nAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.\nThe technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order\nto ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.\nAn effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management\nactivities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide\ntechnical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.\nWhere the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical\nvulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service\nprovider. The cloud service provider’s responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should\nbe part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service\nprovider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are\nrespective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example,\nthe cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the\ncloud services.\nOther information\nTechnical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as\nsuch can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).\nThere is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side\neffects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been\napplied.\nIf adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in\nupdating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other\nusers. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.\nWhere software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an\nautomated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without\nthe need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can\nallow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of\nthe installation of the update.\nWhere the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected\nsystems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the\nautomated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over\nwhen the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated\nuntil the operation has completed.\nA weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth:\ntwo countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked\nby strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability\nscanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care\nin reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.\nMany organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization\nbut also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems,\nproducts and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically\n  through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database\n  services.\n  For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud\n  computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.\n  ISO/IEC  29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing\n  vulnerability advisories. ISO/IEC 30111 provides detailed information about handling and resolving\n  reported vulnerabilities.\n  8.9 Configuration management\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                      concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Secure_configuration #Protection\n  Control\n  Configurations, including security configurations, of hardware, software, services and networks should\n  be established, documented, implemented, monitored and reviewed.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure hardware, software, services and networks function correctly with required security\n  settings, and configuration is not altered by unauthorized or incorrect changes.\n  Guidance\n  General\n  The organization should define and implement processes and tools to enforce the defined configurations\n  (including security configurations) for hardware, software, services (e.g. cloud services) and networks,\n  for newly installed systems as well as for operational systems over their lifetime.\n  Roles, responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all\n  configuration changes.\n  Standard templates\n  Standard templates for the secure configuration of hardware, software, services and networks should\n  be defined:\n  a)\t using publicly available guidance (e.g. pre-defined templates from vendors and from independent\n    security organizations);\n  b)\t considering the level of protection needed in order to determine a sufficient level of security;\n  c)\n    supporting the organization’s information security policy, topic-specific policies, standards and\n    other security requirements;\n  d)\t considering the feasibility and applicability of security configurations in the organization’s context.\n  The templates should be reviewed periodically and updated when new threats or vulnerabilities need\n  to be addressed, or when new software or hardware versions are introduced.\n  The following should be considered for establishing standard templates for the secure configuration of\n  hardware, software, services and networks:\n  a)\t minimizing the number of identities with privileged or administrator level access rights;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nb)\t disabling unnecessary, unused or insecure identities;\nc)\ndisabling or restricting unnecessary functions and services;\nd)\t restricting access to powerful utility programs and host parameter settings;\ne)\t synchronizing clocks;\nf)\nchanging vendor default authentication information such as default passwords immediately after\ninstallation and reviewing other important default security-related parameters;\ng)\t invoking time-out facilities that automatically log off computing devices after a predetermined\nperiod of inactivity;\nh)\t verifying that licence requirements have been met (see 5.32).\nManaging configurations\nEstablished configurations of hardware, software, services and networks should be recorded and a log\nshould be maintained of all configuration changes. These records should be securely stored. This can\nbe achieved in various ways, such as configuration databases or configuration templates.\nChanges to configurations should follow the change management process (see 8.32).\nConfiguration records can contain as relevant:\na)\t up-to-date owner or point of contact information for the asset;\nb)\t date of the last change of configuration;\nc)\nversion of configuration template;\nd)\t relation to configurations of other assets.\nMonitoring configurations\nConfigurations should be monitored with a comprehensive set of system management tools (e.g.\nmaintenance utilities, remote support, enterprise management tools, backup and restore software) and\nshould be reviewed on a regular basis to verify configuration settings, evaluate password strengths\nand assess activities performed. Actual configurations can be compared with the defined target\ntemplates.

Depending on the sensitivity of\ninformation deleted, logs can track or verify that these deletion processes have happened.\nTo avoid the unintentional exposure of sensitive information when equipment is being sent back to\nvendors, sensitive information should be protected by removing auxiliary storages (e.g. hard disk\ndrives) and memory before equipment leaves the organization’s premises.\nConsidering that the secure deletion of some devices (e.g. smartphones) can only be achieved through\ndestruction or using the functions embedded in these devices (e.g. “restore factory settings”), the\norganization should choose the appropriate method according to the classification of information\nhandled by such devices.\nControl measures described in 7.14 should be applied to physically destroy the storage device and\nsimultaneously delete the information it contains.\nAn official record of information deletion is useful when analysing the cause of a possible information\nleakage event.\nOther information\nInformation on user data deletion in cloud services can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.\nInformation on deletion of PII can be found in ISO/IEC 27555.\n8.11\tData masking\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                            Operational\n                            capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n                  #Protect\n                          #Information_protection #Protection\nControl\nData masking should be used in accordance with the organization’s topic-specific policy on access\ncontrol and other related topic-specific policies, and business requirements, taking applicable\nlegislation into consideration.\nPurpose\nTo limit the exposure of sensitive data including PII, and to comply with legal, statutory, regulatory and\ncontractual requirements.\nGuidance\nWhere the protection of sensitive data (e.g. PII) is a concern, the organization should consider hiding\nsuch data by using techniques such as data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization.\nPseudonymization or anonymization techniques can hide PII, disguise the true identity of PII principals\nor other sensitive information, and disconnect the link between PII and the identity of the PII principal\nor the link between other sensitive information.\nWhen using pseudonymization or anonymization techniques, it should be verified that data has been\nadequately pseudonymized or anonymized. Data anonymization should consider all the elements\nof the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can\nbe identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of\nfurther data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.\nAdditional techniques for data masking include:\na)\t encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);\nb)\t nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages);\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  c)\n    varying numbers and dates;\n  d)\t substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data);\n  e)\t replacing values with their hash.\n  The following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques:\n  a)\t not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show\n    only the minimum required data to the user;\n  b)\t there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of\n    data; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient\n    does not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the\n    hospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff\n    with specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment);\n  c)\n    when data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if\n    the data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example\n    if the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or\n    results of blood exams has been obfuscated);\n  d)\t any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information\n    during processing or storage).\n  The following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization:\n  a)\t level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of\n    the processed data;\n  b)\t access controls to the processed data;\n  c)\n    agreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;\n  d)\t prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal;\n  e)\t keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.\n  Other information\n  Anonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII principal can no longer be identified\n  directly or indirectly.\n  Pseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias. Knowledge of the algorithm\n  (sometimes referred to as the “additional information”) used to perform the pseudonymization allows\n  for at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such “additional information” should\n  therefore be kept separate and protected.\n  While pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be\n  more useful in statistical research.\n  Data masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking\n  can be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and\n  rules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application’s memory).\n  Hash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to prevent enumeration attacks, they\n  should always be combined with a salt function.\n  PII in resource identifiers and their attributes [e.g. file names, uniform resource locators (URLs)] should\n  be either avoided or appropriately anonymized.\n  Additional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds are given in ISO/IEC 27018.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nAdditional information on de-identification techniques is available in ISO/IEC 20889.\n8.12\tData leakage prevention\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n#Detective\n        #Confidentiality\n                  #Protect #Detect\n                            #Information_pro­\n                            tection\n                                    #Protection\n                                    #Defence\nControl\nData leakage prevention measures should be applied to systems, networks and any other devices that\nprocess, store or transmit sensitive information.\nPurpose\nTo detect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure and extraction of information by individuals or\nsystems.\nGuidance\nThe organization should consider the following to reduce the risk of data leakage:\na)\t identifying and classifying information to protect against leakage (e.g. personal information,\npricing models and product designs);\nb)\t monitoring channels of data leakage (e.g. email, file transfers, mobile devices and portable storage\ndevices);\nc)\nacting to prevent information from leaking (e.g. quarantine emails containing sensitive\ninformation).\nData leakage prevention tools should be used to:\na)\t identify and monitor sensitive information at risk of unauthorized disclosure (e.g. in unstructured\ndata on a user’s system);\nb)\t detect the disclosure of sensitive information (e.g. when information is uploaded to untrusted\nthird-party cloud services or sent via email);\nc)\nblock user actions or network transmissions that expose sensitive information (e.g. preventing the\ncopying of database entries into a spreadsheet).\nThe organization should determine if it is necessary to restrict a user’s ability to copy and paste or\nupload data to services, devices and storage media outside of the organization. If that is the case, the\norganization should implement technology such as data leakage prevention tools or the configuration\nof existing tools that allow users to view and manipulate data held remotely but prevent copy and paste\noutside of the organization’s control.\nIf data export is required, the data owner should be allowed to approve the export and hold users\naccountable for their actions.\nTaking screenshots or photographs of the screen should be addressed through terms and conditions of\nuse, training and auditing.\nWhere data is backed up, care should be taken to ensure sensitive information is protected using\nmeasures such as encryption, access control and physical protection of the storage media holding the\nbackup.\nData leakage prevention should also be considered to protect against the intelligence actions of an\nadversary from obtaining confidential or secret information (geopolitical, human, financial, commercial,\nscientific or any other) which can be of interest for espionage or can be critical for the community. The\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  data leakage prevention actions should be oriented to confuse the adversary’s decisions for example by\n  replacing authentic information with false information, either as an independent action or as response\n  to the adversary’s intelligence actions. Examples of these kinds of actions are reverse social engineering\n  or the use of honeypots to attract attackers.\n  Other information\n  Data leakage prevention tools are designed to identify data, monitor data usage and movement, and\n  take actions to prevent data from leaking (e.g. alerting users to their risky behaviour and blocking the\n  transfer of data to portable storage devices).\n  Data leakage prevention inherently involves monitoring personnel’s communications and online\n  activities, and by extension external party messages, which raises legal concerns that should be\n  considered prior to deploying data leakage prevention tools. There is a variety of legislation relating to\n  privacy, data protection, employment, interception of data and telecommunications that is applicable to\n  monitoring and data processing in the context of data leakage prevention.\n  Data leakage prevention can be supported by standard security controls, such as topic-specific policies\n  on access control and secure document management (see 5.12 and 5.15).\n  8.13\tInformation backup\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Corrective\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Recover\n                              #Continuity\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  Backup copies of information, software and systems should be maintained and regularly tested in\n  accordance with the agreed topic-specific policy on backup.\n  Purpose\n  To enable recovery from loss of data or systems.\n  Guidance\n  A topic-specific policy on backup should be established to address the organization’s data retention and\n  information security requirements.\n  Adequate backup facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software can\n  be recovered following an incident or failure or loss of storage media.\n  Plans should be developed and implemented for how the organization will back up information,\n  software and systems, to address the topic-specific policy on backup.\n  When designing a backup plan, the following items should be taken into consideration:\n  a)\t producing accurate and complete records of the backup copies and documented restoration\n    procedures;\n  b)\t reflecting the business requirements of the organization (e.g. the recovery point objective, see\n    5.30), the security requirements of the information involved and the criticality of the information\n    to the continued operation of the organization in the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and\n    frequency of backups;\n  c)\n    storing the backups in a safe and secure remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any\n    damage from a disaster at the main site;\n  d)\t giving backup information an appropriate level of physical and environmental protection (see\n    Clause 7 and 8.1) consistent with the standards applied at the main site;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\ne)\t regularly testing backup media to ensure that they can be relied on for emergency use when\nnecessary.

This should be\ncombined with a test of the restoration procedures and checked against the restoration time required\nby the business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems and services, backup measures should\ncover all systems information, applications and data necessary to recover the complete system in the\nevent of a disaster.\nWhen the organization uses a cloud service, backup copies of the organization’s information,\napplications and systems in the cloud service environment should be taken. The organization should\ndetermine if and how requirements for backup are fulfilled when using the information backup service\nprovided as part of the cloud service.\nThe retention period for essential business information should be determined, taking into account\nany requirement for retention of archive copies. The organization should consider the deletion of\ninformation (see 8.10) in storage media used for backup once the information’s retention period expires\nand should take into consideration legislation and regulations.\nOther information\nFor further information on storage security including retention consideration, see ISO/IEC 27040.\n8.14\tRedundancy of information processing facilities\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                            Operational\n                            capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                          #Continuity\n                          #Asset_management\n                                    #Protection\n                                    #Resilience\nControl\nInformation processing facilities should be implemented with redundancy sufficient to meet availability\nrequirements.\nPurpose\nTo ensure the continuous operation of information processing facilities.\nGuidance\nThe organization should identify requirements for the availability of business services and information\nsystems. The organization should design and implement systems architecture with appropriate\nredundancy to meet these requirements.\nRedundancy can be introduced by duplicating information processing facilities in part or in their\nentirety (i.e. spare components or having two of everything). The organization should plan and\nimplement procedures for the activation of the redundant components and processing facilities.\nThe procedures should establish if the redundant components and processing activities are always\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  activated, or in case of emergency, automatically or manually activated. The redundant components\n  and information processing facilities should ensure the same security level as the primary ones.\n  Mechanisms should be in place to alert the organization to any failure in the information processing\n  facilities, enable executing the planned procedure and allow continued availability while the\n  information processing facilities are repaired or replaced.\n  The organization should consider the following when implementing redundant systems:\n  a)\t contracting with two or more suppliers of network and critical information processing facilities\n    such as internet service providers;\n  b)\t using redundant networks;\n  c)\n    using two geographically separate data centres with mirrored systems;\n  d)\t using physically redundant power supplies or sources;\n  e)\t using multiple parallel instances of software components, with automatic load balancing between\n    them (between instances in the same data centre or in different data centres);\n  f)\n    having duplicated components in systems (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memories) or in networks (e.g.\n    firewalls, routers, switches).\n  Where applicable, preferably in production mode, redundant information systems should be tested to\n  ensure the failover from one component to another component works as intended.\n  Other information\n  There is a strong relationship between redundancy and ICT readiness for business continuity (see 5.30)\n  especially if short recovery times are required. Many of the redundancy measures can be part of the\n  ICT continuity strategies and solutions.\n  The implementation of redundancies can introduce risks to the integrity (e.g. processes of copying\n  data to duplicated components can introduce errors) or confidentiality (e.g. weak security control of\n  duplicated components can lead to compromise) of information and information systems, which need\n  to be considered when designing information systems.\n  Redundancy in information processing facilities does not usually address application unavailability due\n  to faults within an application.\n  With the use of public cloud computing, it is possible to have multiple live versions of information\n  processing facilities, existing in multiple separate physical locations with automatic failover and load\n  balancing between them.\n  Some of the technologies and techniques for providing redundancy and automatic fail-over in the\n  context of cloud services are discussed in ISO/IEC TS 23167.\n  8.15\tLogging\n    Control type\n            Information\n            security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                        Security domains\n  #Detective\n            #Confidentiality\n            #Integrity\n            #Availability\n                    #Detect\n                              #Information_securi­\n                              ty_event_management\n                                        #Protection\n                                        #Defence\n  Control\n  Logs that record activities, exceptions, faults and other relevant events should be produced, stored,\n  protected and analysed.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nPurpose\nTo record events, generate evidence, ensure the integrity of log information, prevent against\nunauthorized access, identify information security events that can lead to an information security\nincident and to support investigations.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nThe organization should determine the purpose for which logs are created, what data is collected and\nlogged, and any log-specific requirements for protecting and handling the log data. This should be\ndocumented in a topic-specific policy on logging.\nEvent logs should include for each event, as applicable:\na)\t user IDs;\nb)\t system activities;\nc)\ndates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and log-off);\nd)\t device identity, system identifier and location;\ne)\t network addresses and protocols.\nThe following events should be considered for logging:\na)\t successful and rejected system access attempts;\nb)\t successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;\nc)\nchanges to system configuration;\nd)\t use of privileges;\ne)\t use of utility programs and applications;\nf)\nfiles accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important data files;\ng)\t alarms raised by the access control system;\nh)\t activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection\nsystems;\ni)\ncreation, modification or deletion of identities;\nj)\ntransactions executed by users in applications. In some cases, the applications are a service or\nproduct provided or run by a third party.\nIt is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see 8.17) as this allows for correlation\nof logs between systems for analysis, alerting and investigation of an incident.\nProtection of logs\nUsers, including those with privileged access rights, should not have permission to delete or de-activate\nlogs of their own activities. They can potentially manipulate the logs on information processing\nfacilities under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to protect and review the logs to maintain\naccountability for the privileged users.\nControls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log information and operational\nproblems with the logging facility including:\na)\t alterations to the message types that are recorded;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  b)\t log files being edited or deleted;\n  c)\n    failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if the storage media holding a log\n    file is exceeded.\n  For protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be considered: cryptographic hashing,\n  recording in an append-only and read-only file, recording in a public transparency file.\n  Some audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements on data retention or\n  requirements to collect and retain evidence (see 5.28).\n  Where the organization needs to send system or application logs to a vendor to assist with debugging or\n  troubleshooting errors, logs should be de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see\n  8.11) for information such as usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization\n  name, before sending to the vendor.\n  Event logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy\n  protection measures should be taken (see 5.34).\n  Log analysis\n  Log analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of information security events, to help identify\n  unusual activity or anomalous behaviour, which can represent indicators of compromise.\n  Analysis of events should be performed by taking into account:\n  a)\t the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis;\n  b)\t determining the procedure of log analysis;\n  c)\n    the required attributes of each security-related event;\n  d)\t exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules [e.g. security information and\n    event management (SIEM) or firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or malware\n    signatures];\n  e)\t known behaviour patterns and standard network traffic compared to anomalous activity and\n    behaviour [user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA)];\n  f)\n    results of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. as a result of using data analytics, big data techniques and\n    specialized analysis tools);\n  g)\t available threat intelligence.\n  Log analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to help identify and analyse\n  anomalous behaviour, which includes:\n  a)\t reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources [e.g. domain name\n    system (DNS) servers, web portals and file shares];\n  b)\t checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to malicious servers, such as those\n    associated with botnet command and control servers;\n  c)\n    examining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or service reports) for unusual\n    activity within systems and networks (e.g. by reviewing patterns of activity);\n  d)\t including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and exit to ensure more accurate\n    detection and incident analysis;\n  e)\t correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nSuspected and actual information security incidents should be identified (e.g. malware infection or\nprobing of firewalls) and be subject to further investigation (e.g. as part of an information security\nincident management process, see 5.25).\nOther information\nSystem logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to information\nsecurity monitoring. To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes,\nthe use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file interrogation can be considered.\nEvent logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems (see 8.16) which are capable of\ngenerating consolidated reports and alerts on system security.\nA SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate, normalize and analyse log information,\nand to generate alerts. SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimize their benefits.\nConfigurations to consider include identification and selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and\ntesting of rules and development of use cases.\nPublic transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for example, in certificate transparency\nsystems. Such files can provide an additional detection mechanism useful for guarding against log\ntampering.\nIn cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared between the cloud service\ncustomer and the cloud service provider. Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service\nbeing used. Further guidance can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.\n8.16\tMonitoring activities\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Detective\n#Corrective\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity #Availability\n                  #Detect #Respond\n                            #Information_securi­\n                            ty_event_management\n                                      #Defence\nControl\nNetworks, systems and applications should be monitored for anomalous behaviour and appropriate\nactions taken to evaluate potential information security incidents.\nPurpose\nTo detect anomalous behaviour and potential information security incidents.\nGuidance\nThe monitoring scope and level should be determined in accordance with business and information\nsecurity requirements and taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations. Monitoring records\nshould be maintained for defined retention periods.\nThe following should be considered for inclusion within the monitoring system:\na)\t outbound and inbound network, system and application traffic;\nb)\t access to systems, servers, networking equipment, monitoring system, critical applications, etc.;\nc)\ncritical or admin level system and network configuration files;\nd)\t logs from security tools [e.g. antivirus, IDS, intrusion prevention system (IPS), web filters, firewalls,\ndata leakage prevention];\ne)\t event logs relating to system and network activity;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  f)\n    checking that the code being executed is authorized to run in the system and that it has not been\n    tampered with (e.g. by recompilation to add additional unwanted code);\n  g)\t use of the resources (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memory, bandwidth) and their performance.\n  The organization should establish a baseline of normal behaviour and monitor against this baseline for\n  anomalies. When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered:\n  a)\t reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;\n  b)\t usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users.\n  The monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous\n  behaviour, such as:\n  a)\t unplanned termination of processes or applications;\n  b)\t activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses\n    or network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers);\n  c)\n    known attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows);\n  d)\t unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of\n    standard protocols);\n  e)\t bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter);\n  f)\n    unauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;\n  g)\t unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks;\n  h)\t successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals\n    and file systems);\n  i)\n    unusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.\n  Continuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or\n  in periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include\n  the ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow\n  for real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or\n  network or application behaviour patterns.\n  Automated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles,\n  email messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system\n  should be tuned and trained on the organization’s baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should\n  be dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential\n  incidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert\n  notifications.\n  Abnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following\n  activities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures\n  should be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in\n  order to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security. Procedures should\n  also be established to identify and address false positives including tuning the monitoring software to\n  reduce the number of future false positives.\n  Other information\n  Security monitoring can be enhanced by:\n  a)\t leveraging threat intelligence systems (see 5.7);\n  b)\t leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nc)\nusing blocklists or allowlists;\nd)\t undertaking a range of technical security assessments (e.g. vulnerability assessments, penetration\ntesting, cyber-attack simulations and cyber response exercises), and using the results of these\nassessments to help determine baselines or acceptable behaviour;\ne)\t using performance monitoring systems to help establish and detect anomalous behaviour;\nf)\nleveraging logs in combination with monitoring systems.\nMonitoring activities are often conducted using specialist software, such as intrusion detection\nsystems. These can be configured to a baseline of normal, acceptable and expected system and network\nactivities.\nMonitoring for anomalous communications helps in the identification of botnets (i.e. set of devices\nunder the malicious control of the botnet owner, usually used for mounting distributed denial of service\nattacks on other computers of other organizations). If the computer is being controlled by an external\ndevice, there is a communication between the infected device and the controller. The organization\nshould therefore employ technologies to monitor for anomalous communications and take such action\nas necessary.\n8.17\tClock synchronization\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Detective\n      #Integrity\n                  #Protect #Detect\n                            #Information_securi­\n                            ty_event_management\n                                      #Protection\n                                      #Defence\nControl\nThe clocks of information processing systems used by the organization should be synchronized to\napproved time sources.\nPurpose\nTo enable the correlation and analysis of security-related events and other recorded data, and to\nsupport investigations into information security incidents.\nGuidance\nExternal and internal requirements for time representation, reliable synchronization and accuracy\nshould be documented and implemented. Such requirements can be from legal, statutory, regulatory,\ncontractual, standards and internal monitoring needs. A standard reference time for use within the\norganization should be defined and considered for all systems, including building management systems,\nentry and exit systems and others that can be used to aid investigations.\nA clock linked to a radio time broadcast from a national atomic clock or global positioning system (GPS)\nshould be used as the reference clock for logging systems; a consistent, trusted date and time source to\nensure accurate time-stamps. Protocols such as network time protocol (NTP) or precision time protocol\n(PTP) should be used to keep all networked systems in synchronization with a reference clock.\nThe organization can use two external time sources at the same time in order to improve the reliability\nof external clocks, and appropriately manage any variance.\nClock synchronization can be difficult when using multiple cloud services or when using both cloud\nand on-premises services. In this case, the clock of each service should be monitored and the difference\nrecorded in order to mitigate risks arising from discrepancies.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Other information\n  The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of event logs, which can\n  be required for investigations or as evidence in legal and disciplinary cases. Inaccurate audit logs can\n  hinder such investigations and damage the credibility of such evidence.\n  8.18\tUse of privileged utility programs\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                          Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #System_and_net­\n                              work_security\n                              #Secure_configura­\n                              tion\n                              #Application_security\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  The use of utility programs that can be capable of overriding system and application controls should be\n  restricted and tightly controlled.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure the use of utility programs does not harm system and application controls for information\n  security.\n  Guidance\n  The following guidelines for the use of utility programs that can be capable of overriding system and\n  application controls should be considered:\n  a)\t limitation of the use of utility programs to the minimum practical number of trusted, authorized\n    users (see 8.2);\n  b)\t use of identification, authentication and authorization procedures for utility programs, including\n    unique identification of the person who uses the utility program;\n  c)\n    defining and documenting of authorization levels for utility programs;\n  d)\t authorization for ad hoc use of utility programs;\n  e)\t not making utility programs available to users who have access to applications on systems where\n    segregation of duties is required;\n  f)\n    removing or disabling all unnecessary utility programs;\n  g)\t at a minimum, logical segregation of utility programs from application software.

Software\npatches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce information security vulnerabilities\n(see 8.8 and 8.19).\nComputer software can rely on externally supplied software and packages (e.g. software programs\nusing modules which are hosted on external sites), which should be monitored and controlled to avoid\nunauthorized changes, because they can introduce information security vulnerabilities.\nVendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported\nby the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The\norganization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software. Open source software used\nin operational systems should be maintained to the latest appropriate release of the software. Over\ntime, open source code can cease to be maintained but is still available in an open source software\nrepository. The organization should also consider the risks of relying on unmaintained open source\nsoftware when used in operational systems.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  When suppliers are involved in installing or updating software, physical or logical access should\n  only be given when necessary and with appropriate authorization.

In particular, the following items should be considered:\n  a)\t the type and classification level of information that the network can support;\n  b)\t establishing responsibilities and procedures for the management of networking equipment and\n    devices;\n  c)\n    maintaining up to date documentation including network diagrams and configuration files of\n    devices (e.g. routers, switches);\n  d)\t separating operational responsibility for networks from ICT system operations where appropriate\n    (see 5.3);\n  e)\t establishing controls to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over public\n    networks, third-party networks or over wireless networks and to protect the connected systems\n    and applications (see 5.22, 8.24, 5.14 and 6.6).

The domains\n  can be chosen based on levels of trust, criticality and sensitivity (e.g. public access domain, desktop\n  domain, server domain, low- and high-risk systems), along organizational units (e.g. human resources,\n  finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational\n  units). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different\n  logical networks.\n  The perimeter of each domain should be well-defined. If access between network domains is allowed,\n  it should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria for\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nsegregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based\non an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance\nwith the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15), access requirements, value and classification\nof information processed and take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating\nsuitable gateway technology.\nWireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined network perimeter. Radio\ncoverage adjustment should be considered for segregation of wireless networks. For sensitive\nenvironments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and\nto segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in\naccordance with network controls (see 8.20) before granting access to internal systems. Wireless access\nnetwork for guests should be segregated from those for personnel if personnel only use controlled user\nendpoint devices compliant to the organization’s topic-specific policies. WiFi for guests should have\nat least the same restrictions as WiFi for personnel, in order to discourage the use of guest WiFi by\npersonnel.\nOther information\nNetworks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that\nrequire the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such\nextensions can increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization’s information systems\nthat use the network, some of which require protection from other network users because of their\nsensitivity or criticality.\n8.23 Web filtering\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #System_and_net­\n                            work_security\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nAccess to external websites should be managed to reduce exposure to malicious content.\nPurpose\nTo protect systems from being compromised by malware and to prevent access to unauthorized web\nresources.\nGuidance\nThe organization should reduce the risks of its personnel accessing websites that contain illegal\ninformation or are known to contain viruses or phishing material. A technique for achieving this works\nby blocking the IP address or domain of the website(s) concerned.

The organization should consider blocking access to the following types of websites:\na)\t websites that have an information upload function unless permitted for valid business reasons;\nb)\t known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. those distributing malware or phishing contents);\nc)\ncommand and control servers;\nd)\t malicious website acquired from threat intelligence (see 5.7);\ne)\t websites sharing illegal content.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Prior to deploying this control, the organization should establish rules for safe and appropriate use\n  of online resources, including any restriction to undesirable or inappropriate websites and web-based\n  applications. The rules should be kept up-to-date.\n  Training should be given to personnel on the secure and appropriate use of online resources including\n  access to the web. The training should include the organization’s rules, contact point for raising security\n  concerns, and exception process when restricted web resources need to be accessed for legitimate\n  business reasons. Training should also be given to personnel to ensure that they do not overrule any\n  browser advisory that reports that a website is not secure but allows the user to proceed.\n  Other information\n  Web filtering can include a range of techniques including signatures, heuristics, list of acceptable\n  websites or domains, list of prohibited websites or domains and bespoke configuration to help prevent\n  malicious software and other malicious activity from attacking the organization’s network and systems.\n  8.24\tUse of cryptography\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                  Operational\n                                  capabilities\n                                          Security do­\n                                            mains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Secure_configuration\n                                          #Protection\n  Control\n  Rules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, should be defined\n  and implemented.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity or\n  integrity of information according to business and information security requirements, and taking into\n  consideration legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements related to cryptography.\n  Guidance\n  General\n  When using cryptography, the following should be considered:\n  a)\t the topic-specific policy on cryptography defined by the organization, including the general\n    principles for the protection of information. A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is\n    necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and\n    to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use;\n  b)\t identifying the required level of protection and the classification of the information and\n    consequently establishing the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required;\n  c)\n    the use of cryptography for protection of information held on mobile user endpoint devices or\n    storage media and transmitted over networks to such devices or storage media;\n  d)\t the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the generation and protection of\n    cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or\n    damaged keys;\n  e)\t roles and responsibilities for:\n    1)\t the implementation of the rules for the effective use of cryptography;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n2)\t the key management, including key generation (see 8.24);\nf)\nthe standards to be adopted, as well as cryptographic algorithms, cipher strength, cryptographic\nsolutions and usage practices that are approved or required for use in the organization;\ng)\t the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely on content inspection (e.g. malware\ndetection or content filtering).\nWhen implementing the organization’s rules for effective use of cryptography, the regulations and\nnational restrictions that can apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world\nshould be taken into consideration as well as the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information\n(see 5.31).\nThe contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services\n(e.g. with a certification authority) should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response\ntimes for the provision of services (see 5.22).\nKey management\nAppropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving,\ndistributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys.\nA key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures and secure\nmethods for:\na)\t generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications;\nb)\t issuing and obtaining public key certificates;\nc)\ndistributing keys to intended entities, including how to activate keys when received;\nd)\t storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;\ne)\t changing or updating keys including rules on when to change keys and how this will be done;\nf)\ndealing with compromised keys;\ng)\t revoking keys including how to withdraw or deactivate keys [e.g. when keys have been compromised\nor when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived)];\nh)\t recovering keys that are lost or corrupted;\ni)\nbacking up or archiving keys;\nj)\ndestroying keys;\nk)\t logging and auditing of key management related activities;\nl)\nsetting activation and deactivation dates for keys so that the keys can only be used for the period of\ntime according to the organization's rules on key management;\nm)\t handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys (e.g. encrypted information can be\nrequired to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case).\nAll cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private\nkeys need protection against unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store\nand archive keys should be physically protected.\nIn addition to integrity, for many use cases, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Other information\n  The authenticity of public keys is usually addressed by public key management processes using\n  certificate authorities and public key certificates, but it is also possible to address it by using\n  technologies such as applying manual processes for small number keys.\n  Cryptography can be used to achieve different information security objectives, for example:\n  a)\t confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either\n    stored or transmitted;\n  b)\t integrity or authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to verify the\n    authenticity or integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information. Using algorithms\n    for the purpose of file integrity checking;\n  c)\n    non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to provide evidence of the occurrence or non-\n    occurrence of an event or action;\n  d)\t authentication: using cryptographic techniques to authenticate users and other system entities\n    requesting access to or transacting with system users, entities and resources.\n  The ISO/IEC 11770 series provides further information on key management.\n  8.25\tSecure development life cycle\n    Control type\n            Information\n            security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                          Security domains\n  #Preventive\n            #Confidentiality\n            #Integrity\n            #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Application_security\n                              #System_and_net­\n                              work_security\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  Rules for the secure development of software and systems should be established and applied.\n  Purpose\n  To ensure information security is designed and implemented within the secure development life cycle\n  of software and systems.\n  Guidance\n  Secure development is a requirement to build up a secure service, architecture, software and system.\n  To achieve this, the following aspects should be considered:\n  a)\t separation of development, test and production environments (see 8.31);\n  b)\t guidance on the security in the software development life cycle:\n    1)\t security in the software development methodology (see 8.28 and 8.27);\n    2)\t secure coding guidelines for each programming language used (see 8.28);\n  c)\n    security requirements in the specification and design phase (see 5.8);\n  d)\t security checkpoints in projects (see 5.8);\n  e)\t system and security testing, such as regression testing, code scan and penetration tests (see 8.29);\n  f)\n    secure repositories for source code and configuration (see 8.4 and 8.9);\n  g)\t security in the version control (see 8.32);\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nh)\t required application security knowledge and training (see 8.28);\ni)\ndevelopers’ capability for preventing, finding and fixing vulnerabilities (see 8.28);\nj)\nlicensing requirements and alternatives to ensure cost-effective solutions while avoiding future\nlicensing issues (See 5.32).\nIf development is outsourced, the organization should obtain assurance that the supplier complies with\nthe organization’s rules for secure development (see 8.30).\nOther information\nDevelopment can also take place inside applications, such as office applications, scripting, browsers and\ndatabases.\n8.26\tApplication security requirements\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Application_security\n                            #System_and_net­\n                            work_security\n                                      #Protection\n                                      #Defence\nControl\nInformation security requirements should be identified, specified and approved when developing or\nacquiring applications.\nPurpose\nTo ensure all information security requirements are identified and addressed when developing or\nacquiring applications.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nApplication security requirements should be identified and specified. These requirements are usually\ndetermined through a risk assessment. The requirements should be developed with the support of\ninformation security specialists.\nApplication security requirements can cover a wide range of topics, depending on the purpose of the\napplication.\nApplication security requirements should include, as applicable:\na)\t level of trust in identity of entities [e.g. through authentication (see 5.17, 8.2 and 8.5)];\nb)\t identifying the type of information and classification level to be processed by the application;\nc)\nneed for segregation of access and level of access to data and functions in the application;\nd)\t resilience against malicious attacks or unintentional disruptions [e.g. protection against buffer\noverflow or structured query language (SQL) injections];\ne)\t legal, statutory and regulatory requirements in the jurisdiction where the transaction is generated,\nprocessed, completed or stored;\nf)\nneed for privacy associated with all parties involved;\ng)\t the protection requirements of any confidential information;\nh)\t protection of data while being processed, in transit and at rest;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  i)\n    need to securely encrypt communications between all involved parties;\n  j)\n    input controls, including integrity checks and input validation;\n  k)\t automated controls (e.g. approval limits or dual approvals);\n  l)\n    output controls, also considering who can access outputs and its authorization;\n  m)\t restrictions around content of \"free-text\" fields, as these can lead to uncontrolled storage of\n    confidential data (e.g. personal data);\n  n)\t requirements derived from the business process, such as transaction logging and monitoring,\n    nonrepudiation requirements;\n  o)\t requirements mandated by other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or\n    data leakage detection systems);\n  p)\t error message handling.\n  Transactional services\n  Additionally, for applications offering transactional services between the organization and a partner,\n  the following should be considered when identifying information security requirements:\n  a)\t the level of trust each party requires in each other’s claimed identity;\n  b)\t the level of trust required in the integrity of information exchanged or processed and the\n    mechanisms for identification of lack of integrity (e.g. cyclic redundancy check, hashing, digital\n    signatures);\n  c)\n    authorization processes associated with who can approve contents of, issue or sign key\n    transactional documents;\n  d)\t confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation\n    (e.g. contracts associated with tendering and contract processes);\n  e)\t the confidentiality and integrity of any transactions (e.g. orders, delivery address details and\n    confirmation of receipts);\n  f)\n    requirements on how long to maintain a transaction confidential;\n  g)\t insurance and other contractual requirements.\n  Electronic ordering and payment applications\n  Additionally, for applications involving electronic ordering and payment, the following should be\n  considered:\n  a)\t requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of order information;\n  b)\t the degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer;\n  c)\n    avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;\n  d)\t storing transaction details outside of any publicly accessible environment (e.g. on a storage platform\n    existing on the organizational intranet, and not retained and exposed on electronic storage media\n    directly accessible from the internet);\n  e)\t where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital\n    signatures or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the entire end-\n    to-end certificate or signature management process.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nSeveral of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptography (see 8.24),\ntaking into consideration legal requirements (see 5.31 to 5.36, especially see 5.31 for cryptography\nlegislation).\nOther information\nApplications accessible via networks are subject to a range of network related threats, such as fraudulent\nactivities, contract disputes or disclosure of information to the public; incomplete transmission, mis-\nrouting, unauthorized message alteration, duplication or replay. Therefore, detailed risk assessments\nand careful determination of controls are indispensable. Controls required often include cryptographic\nmethods for authentication and securing data transfer.\nFurther information on application security can be found in the ISO/IEC 27034 series.\n8.27\tSecure system architecture and engineering principles\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Application_security\n                            #System_and_net­\n                            work_security\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nPrinciples for engineering secure systems should be established, documented, maintained and applied\nto any information system development activities.\nPurpose\nTo ensure information systems are securely designed, implemented and operated within the\ndevelopment life cycle.\nGuidance\nSecurity engineering principles should be established, documented and applied to information\nsystem engineering activities. Security should be designed into all architecture layers (business, data,\napplications and technology). New technology should be analysed for security risks and the design\nshould be reviewed against known attack patterns.\nSecure engineering principles provide guidance on user authentication techniques, secure session\ncontrol and data validation and sanitisation.\nSecure system engineering principles should include analysis of:\na)\t the full range of security controls required to protect information and systems against identified\nthreats;\nb)\t the capabilities of security controls to prevent, detect or respond to security events;\nc)\nspecific security controls required by particular business processes (e.g. encryption of sensitive\ninformation, integrity checking and digitally signing information);\nd)\t where and how security controls are to be applied (e.g. by integrating with a security architecture\nand the technical infrastructure);\ne)\t how individual security controls (manual and automated) work together to produce an integrated\nset of controls.\nSecurity engineering principles should take account of:\na)\t the need to integrate with a security architecture;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  b)\t technical security infrastructure [e.g. public key infrastructure (PKI), identity and access\n    management (IAM), data leakage prevention and dynamic access management];\n  c)\n    capability of the organization to develop and support the chosen technology;\n  d)\t cost, time and complexity of meeting security requirements;\n  e)\t current good practices.\n  Secure system engineering should involve:\n  a)\t the use of security architecture principles, such as “security by design”, “defence in depth”,\n    “security by default”, “default deny”, “fail securely”, “distrust input from external applications”,\n    “security in deployment”, “assume breach”, \"least privilege\", “usability and manageability” and\n    “least functionality”;\n  b)\t a security-oriented design review to help identify information security vulnerabilities, ensure\n    security controls are specified and meet security requirements;\n  c)\n    documentation and formal acknowledgement of security controls that do not fully meet\n    requirements (e.g. due to overriding safety requirements);\n  d)\t hardening of systems.\n  The organization should consider \"zero trust\" principles such as:\n  a)\t assuming the organization’s information systems are already breached and thus not be reliant on\n    network perimeter security alone;\n  b)\t employing a “never trust and always verify” approach for access to information systems;\n  c)\n    ensuring that requests to information systems are encrypted end-to-end;\n  d)\t verifying each request to an information system as if it originated from an open, external network,\n    even if these requests originated internal to the organization (i.e. not automatically trusting\n    anything inside or outside its perimeters);\n  e)\t using \"least privilege\" and dynamic access control techniques (see 5.15, 5.18 and 8.2). This includes\n    authenticating and authorizing requests for information or to systems based on contextual\n    information such as authentication information (see 5.17), user identities (see 5.16), data about the\n    user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12);\n  f)\n    always authenticating requesters and always validating authorization requests to information\n    systems based on information including authentication information (see 5.17) and user identities\n    (5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12), for example enforcing\n    strong authentication (e.g. multi-factor, see 8.5).\n  The established security engineering principles should be applied, where applicable, to outsourced\n  development of information systems through the contracts and other binding agreements between the\n  organization and the supplier to whom the organization outsources. The organization should ensure\n  that suppliers’ security engineering practices align with the organization’s needs.\n  The security engineering principles and the established engineering procedures should be regularly\n  reviewed to ensure that they are effectively contributing to enhanced standards of security within\n  the engineering process. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain up-to-\n  date in terms of combatting any new potential threats and in remaining applicable to advances in the\n  technologies and solutions being applied.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nOther information\nSecure engineering principles can be applied to the design or configuration of a range of techniques,\nsuch as:\n—\t fault tolerance and other resilience techniques;\n—\t segregation (e.g. through virtualization or containerization);\n—\t tamper resistance.\nSecure virtualization techniques can be used to prevent interference between applications running on\nthe same physical device. If a virtual instance of an application is compromised by an attacker, only that\ninstance is affected. The attack has no effect on any other application or data.\nTamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of information containers, whether\nphysical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or logical (e.g. a data file). A characteristic of such techniques is that\nthere is a record of the attempt to tamper with the container. In addition, the control can prevent the\nsuccessful extraction of data through its destruction (e.g. device memory can be deleted).\n8.28\tSecure coding\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                    Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                        Security do­\n                                        mains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Application_security\n                            #System_and_network_\n                            security\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nSecure coding principles should be applied to software development.\nPurpose\nTo ensure software is written securely thereby reducing the number of potential information security\nvulnerabilities in the software.\nGuidance\nGeneral\nThe organization should establish organization-wide processes to provide good governance for secure\ncoding. A minimum secure baseline should be established and applied. Additionally, such processes\nand governance should be extended to cover software components from third parties and open source\nsoftware.\nThe organization should monitor real world threats and up-to-date advice and information on software\nvulnerabilities to guide the organization’s secure coding principles through continual improvement and\nlearning. This can help with ensuring effective secure coding practices are implemented to combat the\nfast-changing threat landscape.\nPlanning and before coding\nSecure coding principles should be used both for new developments and in reuse scenarios. These\nprinciples should be applied to development activities both within the organization and for products\nand services supplied by the organization to others. Planning and prerequisites before coding should\ninclude:\na)\t organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding to be used for both\nin-house and outsourced code developments;\nb)\t common and historical coding practices and defects that lead to information security vulnerabilities;\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  c)\n    configuring development tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), to help enforce\n    the creation of secure code;\n  d)\t following guidance issued by the providers of development tools and execution environments as\n    applicable;\n  e)\t maintenance and use of updated development tools (e.g. compilers);\n  f)\n    qualification of developers in writing secure code;\n  g)\t secure design and architecture, including threat modelling;\n  h)\t secure coding standards and where relevant mandating their use;\n  i)\n    use of controlled environments for development.\n  During coding\n  Considerations during coding should include:\n  a)\t secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques being used;\n  b)\t using secure programming techniques, such as pair programming, refactoring, peer review,\n    security iterations and test-driven development;\n  c)\n    using structured programming techniques;\n  d)\t documenting code and removing programming defects, which can allow information security\n    vulnerabilities to be exploited;\n  e)\t prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of hard-coded passwords, unapproved\n    code samples and unauthenticated web services).\n  Testing should be conducted during and after development (see 8.29). Static application security testing\n  (SAST) processes can identify security vulnerabilities in software.\n  Before software is made operational, the following should be evaluated:\n  a)\t attack surface and the principle of least privilege;\n  b)\t conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and documenting that these have\n    been mitigated.\n  Review and maintenance\n  After code has been made operational:\n  a)\t updates should be securely packaged and deployed;\n  b)\t reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see 8.8);\n  c)\n    errors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly reviewed to make adjustments to\n    the code as necessary;\n  d)\t source code should be protected against unauthorized access and tampering (e.g. by using\n    configuration management tools, which typically provide features such as access control and\n    version control).\n  If using external tools and libraries, the organization should consider:\n  a)\t ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an inventory of libraries used\n    and their versions) and regularly updated with release cycles;\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nb)\t selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components, particularly authentication and\ncryptographic components;\nc)\nthe licence, security and history of external components;\nd)\t ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from proven, reputable sources;\ne)\t sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and artefacts.\nWhere a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered:\na)\t the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;\nb)\t whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;\nc)\nthe possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates;\nd)\t the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a\nresult of changes;\ne)\t compatibility with other software in use.\nOther information\nA guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked when necessary and is tamper-\nresistant. Programs installed from compiled binary code also have these properties but only for\ndata held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is\nexecuted on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its\ndata is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud\nservice where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access\nshould be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong\nauthentication. If the application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the server, so in\nprinciple can an attacker. Webservers should be configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases.\nApplication code is best designed on the assumption that it is always subject to attack, through error or\nmalicious action. In addition, critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal faults. For\nexample, the output from a complex algorithm can be checked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds\nbefore the data is used in an application such as a safety or financial critical application. The code that\nperforms the boundary checks is simple and therefore much easier to prove correctness.\nSome web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities that are introduced by poor design\nand coding, such as database injection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests can be\nmanipulated to abuse the webserver functionality.\nMore information on ICT security evaluation can be found in the ISO/IEC 15408 series.\n8.29\tSecurity testing in development and acceptance\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Identify\n                            #Application_security\n                            #Information_securi­\n                            ty_assurance\n                            #System_and_net­\n                            work_security\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nSecurity testing processes should be defined and implemented in the development life cycle.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Purpose\n  To validate if information security requirements are met when applications or code are deployed to the\n  production environment.\n  Guidance\n  New information systems, upgrades and new versions should be thoroughly tested and verified during\n  the development processes. Security testing should be an integral part of the testing for systems or\n  components.\n  Security testing should be conducted against a set of requirements, which can be expressed as\n  functional or non-functional. Security testing should include testing of:\n  a)\t security functions [e.g. user authentication (see 8.5), access restriction (see 8.3) and use of\n    cryptography (see 8.24)];\n  b)\t secure coding (see 8.28);\n  c)\n    secure configurations (see 8.9, 8.20 and 8.22) including that of operating systems, firewalls and\n    other security components.\n  Test plans should be determined using a set of criteria. The extent of testing should be in proportion to\n  the importance, nature of the system and the potential impact of the change being introduced. The test\n  plan should include:\n  a)\t detailed schedule of activities and tests;\n  b)\t inputs and expected outputs under a range of conditions;\n  c)\n    criteria to evaluate the results;\n  d)\t decision for further actions as necessary.\n  The organization can leverage automated tools, such as code analysis tools or vulnerability scanners,\n  and should verify the remediation of security related defects.\n  For in-house developments, such tests should initially be performed by the development team.\n  Independent acceptance testing should then be undertaken to ensure that the system works as expected\n  and only as expected (see 5.8). The following should be considered:\n  a)\t performing code review activities as a relevant element for testing for security flaws, including un-\n    anticipated inputs and conditions;\n  b)\t performing vulnerability scanning to identify insecure configurations and system vulnerabilities;\n  c)\n    performing penetration testing to identify insecure code and design.\n  For outsourced development and purchasing components, an acquisition process should be followed.\n  Contracts with the supplier should address the identified security requirements (see 5.20). Products\n  and services should be evaluated against these criteria before acquisition.\n  Testing should be performed in a test environment that matches the target production environment\n  as closely as possible to ensure that the system does not introduce vulnerabilities to the organization’s\n  environment and that the tests are reliable (see 8.31).\n  Other information\n  Multiple test environments can be established, which can be used for different kinds of testing (e.g.\n  functional and performance testing). These different environments can be virtual, with individual\n  configurations to simulate a variety of operating environments.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nTesting and monitoring of test environments, tools and technologies also needs to be considered to\nensure effective testing. The same considerations apply to monitoring of the monitoring systems\ndeployed in development, test and production settings. Judgement is needed, guided by the sensitivity\nof the systems and data, to determine how many layers of meta-testing are useful.\n8.30\tOutsourced development\nControl type\n        Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                            Operational\n                            capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n#Detective\n      #Confidentiality\n      #Integrity\n      #Availability\n                  #Identify #Protect\n                  #Detect\n                          #System_and_network_\n                          security\n                          #Application_security\n                          #Supplier_relationships_\n                          security\n                                      #Governance_and_\n                                      Ecosystem\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nThe organization should direct, monitor and review the activities related to outsourced system\ndevelopment.\nPurpose\nTo ensure information security measures required by the organization are implemented in outsourced\nsystem development.\nGuidance\nWhere system development is outsourced, the organization should communicate and agree\nrequirements and expectations, and continually monitor and review whether the delivery of outsourced\nwork meets these expectations. The following points should be considered across the organization’s\nentire external supply chain:\na)\t licensing agreements, code ownership and intellectual property rights related to the outsourced\ncontent (see 5.32);\nb)\t contractual requirements for secure design, coding and testing practices (see 8.25 to 8.29);\nc)\nprovision of the threat model to consider by external developers;\nd)\t acceptance testing for the quality and accuracy of the deliverables (see 8.29);\ne)\t provision of evidence that minimum acceptable levels of security and privacy capabilities are\nestablished (e.g. assurance reports);\nf)\nprovision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to guard against the presence of\nmalicious content (both intentional and unintentional) upon delivery;\ng)\t provision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to guard against the presence of\nknown vulnerabilities;\nh)\t escrow agreements for the software source code (e.g. if the supplier goes out of business);\ni)\ncontractual right to audit development processes and controls;\nj)\nsecurity requirements for the development environment (see 8.31);\nk)\t taking consideration of applicable legislation (e.g. on protection of personal data).\nOther information\nFurther information on supplier relationships can be found in the ISO/IEC 27036 series.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  8.31\tSeparation of development, test and production environments\n  Control type\n            Information\n          security properties\n                      Cybersecurity\n                        concepts\n                                Operational\n                                capabilities\n                                          Security domains\n  #Preventive\n          #Confidentiality\n          #Integrity\n          #Availability\n                    #Protect\n                              #Application_security\n                              #System_and_net­\n                              work_security\n                                        #Protection\n  Control\n  Development, testing and production environments should be separated and secured.\n  Purpose\n  To protect the production environment and data from compromise by development and test activities.\n  Guidance\n  The level of separation between production, testing and development environments that is necessary\n  to prevent production problems should be identified and implemented.\n  The following items should be considered:\n  a)\t adequately separating development and production systems and operating them in different\n    domains (e.g. in separate virtual or physical environments);\n  b)\t defining, documenting and implementing rules and authorization for the deployment of software\n    from development to production status;\n  c)\n    testing changes to production systems and applications in a testing or staging environment prior to\n    being applied to production systems (see 8.29);\n  d)\t not testing in production environments except in circumstances that have been defined and\n    approved;\n  e)\t compilers, editors and other development tools or utility programs not being accessible from\n    production systems when not required;\n  f)\n    displaying appropriate environment identification labels in menus to reduce the risk of error;\n  g)\t not copying sensitive information into the development and testing system environments unless\n    equivalent controls are provided for the development and testing systems.\n  In all cases, development and testing environments should be protected considering:\n  a)\t patching and updating of all the development, integration and testing tools (including builders,\n    integrators, compilers, configuration systems and libraries);\n  b)\t secure configuration of systems and software;\n  c)\n    control of access to the environments;\n  d)\t monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein;\n  e)\t secure monitoring of the environments;\n  f)\n    taking backups of the environments.\n  A single person should not have the ability to make changes to both development and production without\n  prior review and approval. This can be achieved for example through segregation of access rights\n  or through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations, additional measures such as detailed\n  logging and real-time monitoring should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized\n  changes.\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nOther information\nWithout adequate measures and procedures, developers and testers having access to production\nsystems can introduce significant risks (e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment,\nsystem failure, running unauthorized and untested code in production systems, disclosure of\nconfidential data, data integrity and availability issues). There is a need to maintain a known and stable\nenvironment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access to\nthe production environment.\nMeasures and procedures include carefully designed roles in conjunction with implementing\nsegregation of duty requirements and having adequate monitoring processes in place.\nDevelopment and testing personnel also pose a threat to the confidentiality of production information.\nDevelopment and testing activities can cause unintended changes to software or information if they\nshare the same computing environment. Separating development, testing and production environments\nis therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to production\nsoftware and business data (see 8.33 for the protection of test information).\nIn some cases, the distinction between development, test and production environments can be\ndeliberately blurred and testing can be carried out in a development environment or through controlled\nrollouts to live users or servers (e.g. small population of pilot users). In some cases, product testing can\noccur through live use of the product inside the organization. Furthermore, to reduce downtime of live\ndeployments, two identical production environments can be supported where only one is live at any\none time.\nSupporting processes for the use of production data in development and testing environments (8.33)\nare necessary.\nOrganizations can also consider the guidance provided in this section for training environments when\nconducting end user training.\n8.32\tChange management\nControl type\n          Information\n        security properties\n                  Cybersecurity\n                    concepts\n                              Operational\n                              capabilities\n                                      Security domains\n#Preventive\n        #Confidentiality\n        #Integrity\n        #Availability\n                  #Protect\n                            #Application_security\n                            #System_and_net­\n                            work_security\n                                      #Protection\nControl\nChanges to information processing facilities and information systems should be subject to change\nmanagement procedures.\nPurpose\nTo preserve information security when executing changes.\nGuidance\nIntroduction of new systems and major changes to existing systems should follow agreed rules and a\nformal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control and managed implementation.\nManagement responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all\nchanges.\nChange control procedures should be documented and enforced to ensure the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of information in information processing facilities and information systems, for the\nentire system development life cycle from the early design stages through all subsequent maintenance\nefforts.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n  Wherever practicable, change control procedures for ICT infrastructure and software should be\n  integrated.\n  The change control procedures should include:\n  a)\t planning and assessing the potential impact of changes considering all dependencies;\n  b)\t authorization of changes;\n  c)\n    communicating changes to relevant interested parties;\n  d)\t tests and acceptance of tests for the changes (see 8.29);\n  e)\t implementation of changes including deployment plans;\n  f)\n    emergency and contingency considerations including fall-back procedures;\n  g)\t maintaining records of changes that include all of the above;\n  h)\t ensuring that operating documentation (see 5.37) and user procedures are changed as necessary\n    to remain appropriate;\n  i)\n    ensuring that ICT continuity plans and response and recovery procedures (see 5.30) are changed\n    as necessary to remain appropriate.\n  Other information\n  Inadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and information systems is a\n  common cause of system or security failures. Changes to the production environment, especially when\n  transferring software from development to operational environment, can impact on the integrity and\n  availability of applications.\n  Changing software can impact the production environment and vice versa.\n  Good practice includes the testing of ICT components in an environment segregated from both the\n  production and development environments (see 8.31). This provides a means of having control over\n  new software and allowing additional protection of operational information that is used for testing\n  purposes. This should include patches, service packs and other updates.\n  Production environment includes operating systems, databases and middleware platforms.

 of attributes proposed in this document and create their own attributes with different values to\n  address specific needs in the organization. In addition, the values assigned to each attribute can differ\n  between organizations since organizations can have different views on the use or applicability of the\n  control or of the values associated to the attribute (when the values are specific to the context of the\n  organization). The first step is to understand why an organizational-specific attribute is desirable. For\n  example, if an organization has constructed its risk treatment plans [see ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 6.1.3 e)]\n  based on events, it can wish to associate a risk scenario attribute to each control in this document.\n                    Table A.2 (continued)\nISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\nThe benefit of such an attribute is to speed up the process of fulfilment of ISO/IEC 27001 requirement\nrelated to risk treatment, which is to compare the controls determined through the process of risk\ntreatment (referred to as “necessary” controls), with those in ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Annex A (which are\nissued from in this document) to ensure that no necessary control has been overlooked.\nOnce the purpose and benefits are known, the next step is to determine the attribute values. For\nexample, the organization might identify 9 events:\n1)\t loss or theft of mobile device;\n2)\t loss or theft from organization’s premises;\n3)\t force majeure, vandalism and terrorism;\n4)\t failure of software, hardware, power, internet and communications;\n5)\t fraud;\n6)\t hacking;\n7)\t disclosure;\n8)\t breach of the law;\n9)\t social engineering.\nThe second step can therefore be accomplished by assigning identifiers to each event (e.g. E1, E2, ..., E9).\nThe third step is to copy the control identifiers and control names from this document into a spreadsheet\nor database and associate the attribute values with each control, remembering that each control can\nhave more than one attribute value.\nThe final step is to sort the spreadsheet or query the database to extract the required information.\nOther examples of organizational attributes (and possible values) include:\na)\t maturity (values from the ISO/IEC 33000 series or other maturity models);\nb)\t implementation state (to do, in progress, partially implemented, fully implemented);\nc)\npriority (1, 2, 3, etc.);\nd)\t organizational areas involved (security, ICT, human resources, top management, etc.);\ne)\t events;\nf)\nassets involved;\ne)\t build and run, to differentiate controls used in the different steps of the service life cycle;\ng)\t other frameworks the organization works with or can be transitioning from.\n  \b\n                                      ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)\n                      Annex B\n                    (informative)\n  Correspondence of ISO/IEC 27002:2022 (this

    "  Introduction",
    "  0.1   Background and context",
    "  This document is designed for organizations of all types and sizes. It is to be used as a reference for",
    "  determining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information",
    "  security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC  27001. It can also be used as a guidance",
    "  document for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security",
    "  controls. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-",
    "  specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific",
    "  information security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than",
    "  those included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.",
    "  Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit)",
    "  create, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic,",
    "  physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).",
    "  The value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas",
    "  and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information",
    "  and other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural,",
    "  accidental or deliberate.",
    "  Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules,",
    "  processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its",
    "  specific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review",
    "  and improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a",
    "  holistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and",
    "  implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a",
    "  coherent management system.",
    "  Many information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be",
    "  secure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that",
    "  can be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate",
    "  management activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place",
    "  requires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.",
    "  A successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require",
    "  participation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject",
    "  matter experts can also be needed.",
    "  A suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the",
    "  organization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated",
    "  assets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the",
    "  organization to achieve the stated business objectives.",
    "  0.2   Information security requirements",
    "  It is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three",
    "  main sources of information security requirements:",
    "  a)\t the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business",
    "    strategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-",
    "    specific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to",
    "    ensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;",
    "  b)\t the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its",
    "    interested parties (trading partners, service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-",
    "    cultural environment;",
    "                                                vii",
    "ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)",
    "c)",
    "the set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all the steps of the life cycle of",
    "information that an organization has developed to support its operations.",
    "0.3   Controls",
    "A control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk. Some of the controls in this document",
    "are controls that modify risk, while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for example,",
    "can only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the information security policy can modify risk.",
    "Moreover, some controls describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This document",
    "provides a generic mixture of organizational, people, physical and technological information security",
    "controls derived from internationally recognized best practices.",
    "0.4   Determining controls",
    "Determining controls is dependent on the organization’s decisions following a risk assessment, with",
    "a clearly defined scope. Decisions related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk",
    "acceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach applied by the organization. The",
    "determination of controls should also take into consideration all relevant national and international",
    "legislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the manner in which controls",
    "interact with one another to provide defence in depth.",
    "The organization can design controls as required or identify them from any source. In specifying such",
    "controls, the organization should consider the resources and investment needed to implement and",
    "operate a control against the business value realized. See ISO/IEC TR 27016 for guidance on decisions",
    "regarding the investment in an ISMS and the economic consequences of these decisions in the context of",
    "competing requirements for resources.",
    "There should be a balance between the resources deployed for implementing controls and the potential",
    "resulting business impact from security incidents in the absence of those controls. The results of a",
    "risk assessment should help guide and determine the appropriate management action, priorities for",
    "managing information security risks and for implementing controls determined necessary to protect",
    "against these risks.",
    "Some of the controls in this document can be considered as guiding principles for information security",
    "management and as being applicable for most organizations. More information about determining",
    "controls and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IEC 27005.",
    "0.5   Developing organization-specific guidelines",
    "This document can be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines.",
    "Not all of the controls and guidance in this document can be applicable to all organizations. Additional",
    "controls and guidelines not included in this document can also be required to address the specific needs",
    "of the organization and the risks that have been identified. When documents are developed containing",
    "additional guidelines or controls, it can be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this document",
    "for future reference.",
    "0.6   Life cycle considerations",
    "Information has a life cycle, from creation to disposal. The value of, and risks to, information can vary",
    "throughout this life cycle (e.g. unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company’s financial accounts is",
    "not significant after they have been published, but integrity remains critical) therefore, information",
    "security remains important to some extent at all stages.",
    "Information systems and other assets relevant to information security have life cycles within which",
    "they are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and",
    "eventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be considered at every",
    "stage. New system development projects and changes to existing systems provide opportunities to",
    "improve security controls while taking into account the organization’s risks and lessons learned from",
    "incidents.",

    "  0.7   Related International Standards",
    "  While this document offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are",
    "  commonly applied in many different organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC  27000 family",
    "  provide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing",
    "  information security.",
    "  Refer to ISO/IEC  27000 for a general introduction to both ISMS and the family of documents.",

    "  ISO/IEC 27011 for telecommunications organizations and ISO 27799 for health). Such standards are",

    "The benefit of such an attribute is to speed up the process of fulfilment of ISO/IEC 27001 requirement",

    "treatment (referred to as “necessary” controls), with those in ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Annex A (which are",

        "Introduction",
        "0.1 Background and context",
        "This document is designed for organizations of all types and sizes. It is to be used as a reference for",
        "determining and implementing controls for information security risk treatment in an information",
        "security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It can also be used as a guidance",
        "document for organizations determining and implementing commonly accepted information security",
        "controls. Furthermore, this document is intended for use in developing industry and organization-",
        "specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific",
        "information security risk environment(s). Organizational or environment-specific controls other than",
        "those included in this document can be determined through risk assessment as necessary.",
        "Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit)",
        "create, collect, process, store, transmit and dispose of information in many forms, including electronic,",
        "physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).",
        "The value of information goes beyond written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas",
        "and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information",
        "and other associated assets deserve or require protection against various risk sources, whether natural,",
        "accidental or deliberate.",
        "Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, rules,",
        "processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. To meet its",
        "specific security and business objectives, the organization should define, implement, monitor, review",
        "and improve these controls where necessary. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IEC 27001 takes a",
        "holistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to determine and",
        "implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls within the overall framework of a",
        "coherent management system.",
        "Many information systems, including their management and operations, have not been designed to be",
        "secure in terms of an ISMS as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and this document. The level of security that",
        "can be achieved only through technological measures is limited and should be supported by appropriate",
        "management activities and organizational processes. Identifying which controls should be in place",
        "requires careful planning and attention to detail while carrying out risk treatment.",
        "A successful ISMS requires support from all personnel in the organization. It can also require",
        "participation from other interested parties, such as shareholders or suppliers. Advice from subject",
        "matter experts can also be needed.",
        "A suitable, adequate and effective information security management system provides assurance to the",
        "organization’s management and other interested parties that their information and other associated",
        "assets are kept reasonably secure and protected against threats and harm, thereby enabling the",
        "organization to achieve the stated business objectives.",
        "0.2 Information security requirements",
        "It is essential that an organization determines its information security requirements. There are three",
        "main sources of information security requirements:",
        "a) the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business",
        "strategy and objectives. This can be facilitated or supported through an information security-",
        "specific risk assessment. This should result in the determination of the controls necessary to",
        "ensure that the residual risk to the organization meets its risk acceptance criteria;",
        "b) the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization and its",
        "interested parties (trading partners, service providers, etc.) have to comply with and their socio-",
        "cultural environment;",
        "vii",
        "ISO/IEC 27002:2022(E)",
        "c)",
        "the set of principles, objectives and business requirements for all the steps of the life cycle of",
        "information that an organization has developed to support its operations.",
        "0.3 Controls",
        "A control is defined as a measure that modifies or maintains risk. Some of the controls in this document",
        "are controls that modify risk, while others maintain risk. An information security policy, for example,",
        "can only maintain risk, whereas compliance with the information security policy can modify risk.",
        "Moreover, some controls describe the same generic measure in different risk contexts. This document",
        "provides a generic mixture of organizational, people, physical and technological information security",
        "controls derived from internationally recognized best practices.",
        "0.4 Determining controls",
        "Determining controls is dependent on the organization’s decisions following a risk assessment, with",
        "a clearly defined scope. Decisions related to identified risks should be based on the criteria for risk",
        "acceptance, risk treatment options and the risk management approach applied by the organization. The",
        "determination of controls should also take into consideration all relevant national and international",
        "legislation and regulations. Control determination also depends on the manner in which controls",
        "interact with one another to provide defence in depth.",
        "The organization can design controls as required or identify them from any source. In specifying such",
        "controls, the organization should consider the resources and investment needed to implement and",
        "operate a control against the business value realized. See ISO/IEC TR 27016 for guidance on decisions",
        "regarding the investment in an ISMS and the economic consequences of these decisions in the context of",
        "competing requirements for resources.",
        "There should be a balance between the resources deployed for implementing controls and the potential",
        "resulting business impact from security incidents in the absence of those controls. The results of a",
        "risk assessment should help guide and determine the appropriate management action, priorities for",
        "managing information security risks and for implementing controls determined necessary to protect",
        "against these risks.",
        "Some of the controls in this document can be considered as guiding principles for information security",
        "management and as being applicable for most organizations. More information about determining",
        "controls and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IEC 27005.",
        "0.5 Developing organization-specific guidelines",
        "This document can be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines.",
        "Not all of the controls and guidance in this document can be applicable to all organizations. Additional",
        "controls and guidelines not included in this document can also be required to address the specific needs",
        "of the organization and the risks that have been identified. When documents are developed containing",
        "additional guidelines or controls, it can be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this document",
        "for future reference.",
        "0.6 Life cycle considerations",
        "Information has a life cycle, from creation to disposal. The value of, and risks to, information can vary",
        "throughout this life cycle (e.g. unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company’s financial accounts is",
        "not significant after they have been published, but integrity remains critical) therefore, information",
        "security remains important to some extent at all stages.",
        "Information systems and other assets relevant to information security have life cycles within which",
        "they are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and",
        "eventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be considered at every",
        "stage. New system development projects and changes to existing systems provide opportunities to",
        "improve security controls while taking into account the organization’s risks and lessons learned from",
        "incidents.",

        "commonly applied in many different organizations, other documents in the ISO/IEC 27000 family",

        "The final step is to sort the spreadsheet or query the database to extract the required information.",
