Access control is the method of controlling who or what resources can access premises and systems and what type of access is permitted. There are three key aspects associated with access control: account administration, authentication and authorization. All three aspects shall work together to establish a sound and secure access control strategy. There are several types of authentication strategies and each has varying degrees of strength. Strong authentication methods are ones that are quite accurate in positively identifying the user. Weak authentication methods are ones that can be easily defeated to provide unwanted access to information. Physical location of the user may have a significant impact on the risk of accessing the IACS.

Incident planning and response provides the organization the opportunity to plan for security incidents and then to respond according to the established company practices. No matter how much care is taken in protecting a system, it is always possible that unwanted intrusions might compromise the system. Technology vulnerabilities continue to exist and external threats are increasing in number and sophistication, therefore requiring a robust strategy for determining the appropriate planning and response. Insight gained from actual incidents is captured because it is critical for evaluating and improving the CSMS. Identifying an incident early and responding appropriately can limit the consequences of the event.
